Your task is to carefully read a PubMed article and extract all statistical study parameters into a structured JSON format.\n\n## Output Format\n\nExtract data according to this JSON structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"study_parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"Study Parameters ID\": null,\n      \"Variant Annotation ID\": null,\n      \"Study Type\": null,\n      \"Study Cases\": null,\n      \"Study Controls\": null,\n      \"Characteristics\": \"\",\n      \"Characteristics Type\": \"\",\n      \"Frequency In Cases\": null,\n      \"Allele Of Frequency In Cases\": null,\n      \"Frequency In Controls\": null,\n      \"Allele Of Frequency In Controls\": null,\n      \"P Value\": \"\",\n      \"Ratio Stat Type\": \"\",\n      \"Ratio Stat\": null,\n      \"Confidence Interval Start\": null,\n      \"Confidence Interval Stop\": null,\n      \"Biogeographical Groups\": \"\",\n      \"Variant Annotation ID_norm\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Field Definitions and Extraction Guidelines\n\n### Study Parameters ID\n- Leave as `null` (will be assigned later)\n- Unique identifier for each study parameter entry\n\n### Variant Annotation ID\n- Leave as `null` (will be assigned later)\n- Links to variant annotation data\n\n### Study Type\n- Extract the type of study from methods/design sections\n- Valid values: \"cohort\", \"case/control\", \"case series\", \"cross-sectional\", \"clinical trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"GWAS\", \"replication\", \"prospective\", \"retrospective\", \"linkage\", \"trios\"\n- Use `null` if not clearly stated\n\n### Study Cases\n- Extract the number of participants/cases in the study or sub-cohort\n- Look for phrases like: \"n = 916\", \"780 users\", \"184 patients\"\n- Must be a number (can include decimal if reported)\n\n### Study Controls\n- Extract the number of controls used in association analysis\n- Only applicable for case-control studies\n- Use `null` if not a case-control design or not reported\n\n### Characteristics\n- **Critical field**: Free text describing the cohort or subgroup being analyzed\n- Look for:\n  - Drug names (e.g., \"Statin switch, simvastatin\", \"Statin switch, atorvastatin\")\n  - Disease conditions\n  - Age groups (e.g., \"Age > 65 years\")\n  - Gender specifications (e.g., \"Male patients\", \"Female patients\")\n  - Dose information if relevant to the cohort\n- Be specific and include all distinguishing details\n\n### Characteristics Type\n- Standardized category for the Characteristics field\n- Valid values: \"disease\", \"drug\", \"age group\", \"gender\", \"study cohort\", \"Study Cohort\"\n- Most pharmacogenetics studies use \"Study Cohort\" or \"drug\"\n\n### Frequency In Cases / Frequency In Controls\n- Extract allele frequencies if explicitly reported\n- Format: decimal number (e.g., 0.21, 0.043)\n- Look for phrases like: \"allele frequency was 0.21\", \"MAF = 0.15\"\n\n### Allele Of Frequency In Cases / Allele Of Frequency In Controls\n- The specific allele the frequency refers to\n- Format: single letter or variant notation (e.g., \"C\", \"T\", \"A\")\n\n### P Value\n- **Critical field**: Extract the p-value with its operator\n- Format: \"= 0.025\", \"< 0.001\", \"> 0.05\"\n- ALWAYS include the operator (=, <, >)\n- Look for: \"P = 0.025\", \"*P* = 0.011\", \"p-value = 0.047\"\n\n### Ratio Stat Type\n- Type of statistical ratio reported\n- Valid values: \"OR\" (odds ratio), \"RR\" (relative risk), \"HR\" (hazard ratio), \"Unknown\"\n- Look for: \"HR\", \"odds ratio\", \"relative risk\"\n- Use \"Unknown\" if a p-value is reported but no ratio type is specified\n\n### Ratio Stat\n- The numerical value of the ratio\n- Extract the point estimate: \"HR 1.88\" \u2192 1.88\n- Must be a number\n\n### Confidence Interval Start / Stop\n- Extract the confidence interval bounds\n- From \"95% CI 1.08\u20133.25\": Start = 1.08, Stop = 3.25\n- Watch for various notations: \"1.08-3.25\", \"1.08 to 3.25\", \"(1.08, 3.25)\"\n\n### Biogeographical Groups\n- Population ancestry/ethnicity of study participants\n- Valid values: \"African America/Afro-Caribbean\", \"American\", \"Central/South Asian\", \"East Asian\", \"European\", \"Latino\", \"Near Eastern\", \"Oceanian\", \"Sub-Saharan African\", \"Unknown\", \"Multiple Groups\"\n- \"Multiple Groups\" = study included participants from multiple populations\n- Look in Methods section for population description\n\n### Variant Annotation ID_norm\n- Leave as `null` (will be assigned later)\n\n## Extraction Strategy\n\n1. **Identify all statistical comparisons**: Look for hazard ratios, odds ratios, p-values, and confidence intervals in Results section\n\n2. **Create separate entries for each cohort/comparison**: If the study analyzes multiple drugs, genotypes, or subgroups, create a separate study parameter entry for each\n\n3. **Match statistics to cohorts**: Ensure each HR/OR/p-value is correctly associated with the right patient group or drug\n\n4. **Extract from Tables**: Statistical results are often in tables - extract each row as a separate entry\n\n5. **Handle multiple phenotypes**: If the study uses different outcome definitions (e.g., \"statin switch\" vs \"statin switch + CK measurement\"), create separate entries for each\n\n## Example Extraction\n\n**From the text:**\n\"We confirmed the association of SLCO1B1 c.521C/C genotype with simvastatin intolerance both by using phenotype of switching initial statin to another as a marker of statin intolerance [hazard ratio (HR) 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08\u20133.25, P = 0.025] and statin switching along with creatine kinase measurement (HR 5.44, 95% CI 1.49\u201319.9, P = 0.011).\"\n\n**Study context:**\n- 916 simvastatin users (European population)\n- Cohort study design\n\n**Extract as TWO entries:**\n\nEntry 1:\n```json\n{\n  \"Study Parameters ID\": null,\n  \"Variant Annotation ID\": null,\n  \"Study Type\": null,\n  \"Study Cases\": 916.0,\n  \"Study Controls\": null,\n  \"Characteristics\": \"Statin switch\",\n  \"Characteristics Type\": \"Study Cohort\",\n  \"Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"P Value\": \"= 0.025\",\n  \"Ratio Stat Type\": \"HR\",\n  \"Ratio Stat\": 1.88,\n  \"Confidence Interval Start\": 1.08,\n  \"Confidence Interval Stop\": 3.25,\n  \"Biogeographical Groups\": \"European\",\n  \"Variant Annotation ID_norm\": null\n}\n```\n\nEntry 2:\n```json\n{\n  \"Study Parameters ID\": null,\n  \"Variant Annotation ID\": null,\n  \"Study Type\": null,\n  \"Study Cases\": 916.0,\n  \"Study Controls\": null,\n  \"Characteristics\": \"Statin switch\",\n  \"Characteristics Type\": \"Study Cohort\",\n  \"Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"P Value\": \"= 0.011\",\n  \"Ratio Stat Type\": \"HR\",\n  \"Ratio Stat\": 5.44,\n  \"Confidence Interval Start\": 1.49,\n  \"Confidence Interval Stop\": 19.9,\n  \"Biogeographical Groups\": \"European\",\n  \"Variant Annotation ID_norm\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore submitting your extraction:\n- [ ] Each statistical result has its own entry\n- [ ] P Values include operators (=, <, >)\n- [ ] Confidence intervals are paired correctly (start < stop)\n- [ ] Study Cases numbers are extracted for each cohort\n- [ ] Characteristics describe what makes each cohort unique\n- [ ] All null values are explicitly set to `null`, not empty strings\n- [ ] Biogeographical Groups use exact terminology from the valid values list\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't merge multiple comparisons** - Each HR/OR/RR with its p-value should be a separate entry\n2. **Don't forget the operator in P Values** - Always include =, <, or >\n3. **Don't confuse cohort size** - For sub-analyses (e.g., \"780 atorvastatin users\"), use 780, not the total study N\n4. **Don't use empty strings for missing data** - Use `null` for numeric and null/empty fields\n5. **Don't modify Characteristics text** - Extract as written, maintaining drug names, doses, and descriptions\n\n## Now Extract\n\nRead the provided PubMed article carefully and extract all study parameters following the above guidelines. Return only the JSON output with all extracted entries.",

    "output": "This study evaluated the contribution of rare DPYD variants to interindividual variability in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DPYD exons and flanking splice junctions in 2,972 patients with pretreatment DPD phenotyping by the plasma dihydrouracil/uracil ([UH2]/[U]) ratio. Known high-impact alleles (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T) were confirmed to associate strongly with low DPD activity, and several common variants (including haplotype B3) showed modest effects. Importantly, rare variants (MAF <1%) were significantly enriched among patients with partial DPD deficiency (9.3% vs 3.2%, P < 1e-5), and predicted deleterious rare variants (CADD >15) remained more frequent in the low-activity group (4.2% vs 1.6%, P < 0.001), indicating rare alleles account for a sizable fraction of functional variability. The authors conclude that comprehensive NGS-based DPYD genotyping, alongside phenotyping, could improve pre-emptive identification of patients at risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity; a limitation is the lack of direct clinical toxicity outcomes in this cohort.",
