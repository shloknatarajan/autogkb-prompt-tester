Focus on identifying genetic associations with drug dosing, efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters.\n\n## Output Format\nGenerate a JSON object with a \"var_drug_ann\" array containing annotation objects. Each annotation should capture a specific variant-drug association reported in the article.\n\n## Schema Field Definitions\n\n### Core Identification Fields:\n- **Variant Annotation ID**: Generate a unique integer ID for each annotation\n- **Variant/Haplotypes**: The dbSNP rsID (e.g., rs9923231) or haplotype involved in the association\n- **Gene**: HGNC gene symbol (e.g., VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, UGT1A1)\n- **Drug(s)**: Generic drug name(s) involved in the association\n- **PMID**: PubMed ID from the article\n- **Phenotype Category**: Choose from: \"Dosage\", \"Efficacy\", \"Toxicity\", \"Metabolism/PK\", \"PD\", \"Other\"\n- **Significance**: Based on author's findings - \"yes\" (significant), \"no\" (not significant), or \"not stated\"\n\n### Detailed Annotation Fields:\n- **Notes**: Any relevant curator notes (e.g., \"alleles complemented to + strand\")\n- **Sentence**: A structured sentence describing the association (see template below)\n- **Alleles**: The specific alleles/genotypes being compared (e.g., \"CT + TT\", \"AC + CC\")\n- **Specialty Population**: Special populations if mentioned (e.g., \"pediatric\")\n\n### Sentence Component Fields:\n- **Metabolizer types**: Gene phenotype group if applicable (e.g., \"poor metabolizer\")\n- **isPlural**: \"Is\" or \"Are\" based on grammatical number\n- **Is/Is Not associated**: \"Associated with\" or \"Not associated with\"\n- **Direction of effect**: \"increased\" or \"decreased\" (null if not significant)\n- **PD/PK terms**: Pharmacological measure (e.g., \"dose of\", \"concentration of\", \"metabolism of\")\n- **Multiple drugs And/or**: \"and\" or \"or\" if multiple drugs listed\n- **Population types**: Study population descriptor (e.g., \"in people with\", \"in healthy individuals\")\n- **Population Phenotypes or diseases**: Specific conditions prefixed with \"Disease:\" (comma-separated)\n- **Multiple phenotypes or diseases And/or**: \"and\" or \"or\" for multiple conditions\n- **Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)**: Reference genotype/allele for comparison\n- **Comparison Metabolizer types**: Reference metabolizer phenotype if applicable\n\n## Sentence Template Pattern\nThe sentence should follow this structure:\n`[Alleles/Genotypes] [isPlural] [Is/Is Not associated] [Direction of effect] [PD/PK terms] [Drug(s)] [Population types] [Population Phenotypes or diseases] as compared to [Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)].`\n\nExample: \"Genotypes CT + TT are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary Embolism or Venous Thrombosis as compared to genotype CC.\"\n\n## Extraction Guidelines\n\n1. **Identify Key Findings**: Look for statements about genetic polymorphisms affecting drug response, particularly:\n   - Dose requirements\n   - Treatment efficacy\n   - Adverse effects/toxicity\n   - Drug metabolism rates\n\n2. **Statistical Significance**: \n   - Mark \"yes\" if p-value < 0.05 or authors state significance\n   - Mark \"no\" if explicitly stated as non-significant\n   - Use \"not stated\" if unclear\n\n3. **Direction of Effect**:\n   - \"increased\" = higher dose needed, increased risk, enhanced effect\n   - \"decreased\" = lower dose needed, reduced risk, diminished effect\n   - Leave null if no association found\n\n4. **Population Details**:\n   - Extract all mentioned conditions/diseases\n   - Use \"Disease:\" prefix for each condition\n   - Separate multiple conditions with commas\n   - Use \"and\"/\"or\" based on study design\n\n5. **Genotype Notation**:\n   - For SNPs: Use standard notation (e.g., CC, CT, TT)\n   - For star alleles: Use CYP notation (e.g., *1/*3)\n   - Combine multiple genotypes with \"+\"\n\n6. **Special Considerations**:\n   - If complemented to plus strand, note in \"Notes\" field\n   - Include all indications for drug use mentioned\n   - Preserve author's terminology for metabolizer phenotypes\n\n## Example Input/Output\n\n### Input Article Excerpt:\n\"The patients with variant genotypes of VKORC1 \u22121639G>A required significantly lower warfarin stable weekly doses than those with wild-type genotype (p < 0.001). Patients with AA and GA genotypes required 49.7% and 27.7% significantly lower averages of warfarin doses compared with those with wild-type GG genotype.\"\n\n### Output Annotation:\n```json\n{\n  \"Variant Annotation ID\": 1448624157,\n  \"Variant/Haplotypes\": \"rs9923231\",\n  \"Gene\": \"VKORC1\",\n  \"Drug(s)\": \"warfarin\",\n  \"PMID\": 28550460,\n  \"Phenotype Category\": \"Dosage\",\n  \"Significance\": \"yes\",\n  \"Notes\": \"Please note: alleles have been complemented to the + strand.\",\n  \"Sentence\": \"Genotypes CT + TT are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary Embolism or Venous Thrombosis as compared to genotype CC.\",\n  \"Alleles\": \"CT + TT\",\n  \"Metabolizer types\": null,\n  \"isPlural\": \"Are\",\n  \"Is/Is Not associated\": \"Associated with\",\n  \"Direction of effect\": \"decreased\",\n  \"PD/PK terms\": \"dose of\",\n  \"Population types\": \"in people with\",\n  \"Population Phenotypes or diseases\": \"Disease:Atrial Fibrillation, Disease:Heart valve replacement, Disease:Pulmonary Hypertension, Disease:Pulmonary Embolism, Disease:Venous Thrombosis\",\n  \"Multiple phenotypes or diseases And/or\": \"or\",\n  \"Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)\": \"CC\",\n  \"Comparison Metabolizer types\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Processing Instructions\n\n1. Read the entire article first to understand the study design and population\n2. Identify all variant-drug associations reported\n3. Create one annotation entry per unique variant-drug-outcome combination\n4. If a variant affects multiple aspects (e.g., both efficacy and dosage), create separate annotations\n5. Include both significant and non-significant findings if explicitly reported\n6. Maintain consistency in terminology within the annotation set\n7. Generate normalized fields (PMID_norm, Variant Annotation ID_norm) as string versions\n\nExtract all variant/drug associations from the provided article and return them in the specified JSON format.",

Each annotation should capture a specific variant-drug association reported in the article.\n\n## Schema Field Definitions\n\n### Core Identification Fields:\n- **Variant Annotation ID**: Generate a unique integer ID for each annotation\n- **Variant/Haplotypes**: The dbSNP rsID (e.g., rs9923231) or haplotype involved in the association\n- **Gene**: HGNC gene symbol (e.g., VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, UGT1A1)\n- **Drug(s)**: Generic drug name(s) involved in the association\n- **PMID**: PubMed ID from the article\n- **Phenotype Category**: Choose from: \"Dosage\", \"Efficacy\", \"Toxicity\", \"Metabolism/PK\", \"PD\", \"Other\"\n- **Significance**: Based on author's findings - \"yes\" (significant), \"no\" (not significant), or \"not stated\"\n\n### Detailed Annotation Fields:\n- **Notes**: Any relevant curator notes (e.g., \"alleles complemented to + strand\")\n- **Sentence**: A structured sentence describing the association (see template below)\n- **Alleles**: The specific alleles/genotypes being compared (e.g., \"CT + TT\", \"AC + CC\")\n- **Specialty Population**: Special populations if mentioned (e.g., \"pediatric\")\n\n### Sentence Component Fields:\n- **Metabolizer types**: Gene phenotype group if applicable (e.g., \"poor metabolizer\")\n- **isPlural**: \"Is\" or \"Are\" based on grammatical number\n- **Is/Is Not associated**: \"Associated with\" or \"Not associated with\"\n- **Direction of effect**: \"increased\" or \"decreased\" (null if not significant)\n- **PD/PK terms**: Pharmacological measure (e.g., \"dose of\", \"concentration of\", \"metabolism of\")\n- **Multiple drugs And/or**: \"and\" or \"or\" if multiple drugs listed\n- **Population types**: Study population descriptor (e.g., \"in people with\", \"in healthy individuals\")\n- **Population Phenotypes or diseases**: Specific conditions prefixed with \"Disease:\" (comma-separated)\n- **Multiple phenotypes or diseases And/or**: \"and\" or \"or\" for multiple conditions\n- **Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)**: Reference genotype/allele for comparison\n- **Comparison Metabolizer types**: Reference metabolizer phenotype if applicable\n\n## Sentence Template Pattern\nThe sentence should follow this structure:\n`[Alleles/Genotypes] [isPlural] [Is/Is Not associated] [Direction of effect] [PD/PK terms] [Drug(s)] [Population types] [Population Phenotypes or diseases] as compared to [Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)].`\n\nExample: \"Genotypes CT + TT are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary Embolism or Venous Thrombosis as compared to genotype CC.\"\n\n## Extraction Guidelines\n\n1. **Identify Key Findings**: Look for statements about genetic polymorphisms affecting drug response, particularly:\n   - Dose requirements\n   - Treatment efficacy\n   - Adverse effects/toxicity\n   - Drug metabolism rates\n\n2. **Statistical Significance**: \n   - Mark \"yes\" if p-value < 0.05 or authors state significance\n   - Mark \"no\" if explicitly stated as non-significant\n   - Use \"not stated\" if unclear\n\n3. **Direction of Effect**:\n   - \"increased\" = higher dose needed, increased risk, enhanced effect\n   - \"decreased\" = lower dose needed, reduced risk, diminished effect\n   - Leave null if no association found\n\n4. **Population Details**:\n   - Extract all mentioned conditions/diseases\n   - Use \"Disease:\" prefix for each condition\n   - Separate multiple conditions with commas\n   - Use \"and\"/\"or\" based on study design\n\n5. **Genotype Notation**:\n   - For SNPs: Use standard notation (e.g., CC, CT, TT)\n   - For star alleles: Use CYP notation (e.g., *1/*3)\n   - Combine multiple genotypes with \"+\"\n\n6. **Special Considerations**:\n   - If complemented to plus strand, note in \"Notes\" field\n   - Include all indications for drug use mentioned\n   - Preserve author's terminology for metabolizer phenotypes\n\n## Example Input/Output\n\n### Input Article Excerpt:\n\"The patients with variant genotypes of VKORC1 \u22121639G>A required significantly lower warfarin stable weekly doses than those with wild-type genotype (p < 0.001). Patients with AA and GA genotypes required 49.7% and 27.7% significantly lower averages of warfarin doses compared with those with wild-type GG genotype.\"\n\n### Output Annotation:\n```json\n{\n  \"Variant Annotation ID\": 1448624157,\n  \"Variant/Haplotypes\": \"rs9923231\",\n  \"Gene\": \"VKORC1\",\n  \"Drug(s)\": \"warfarin\",\n  \"PMID\": 28550460,\n  \"Phenotype Category\": \"Dosage\",\n  \"Significance\": \"yes\",\n  \"Notes\": \"Please note: alleles have been complemented to the + strand.\",\n  \"Sentence\": \"Genotypes CT + TT are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary Embolism or Venous Thrombosis as compared to genotype CC.\",\n  \"Alleles\": \"CT + TT\",\n  \"Metabolizer types\": null,\n  \"isPlural\": \"Are\",\n  \"Is/Is Not associated\": \"Associated with\",\n  \"Direction of effect\": \"decreased\",\n  \"PD/PK terms\": \"dose of\",\n  \"Population types\": \"in people with\",\n  \"Population Phenotypes or diseases\": \"Disease:Atrial Fibrillation, Disease:Heart valve replacement, Disease:Pulmonary Hypertension, Disease:Pulmonary Embolism, Disease:Venous Thrombosis\",\n  \"Multiple phenotypes or diseases And/or\": \"or\",\n  \"Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)\": \"CC\",\n  \"Comparison Metabolizer types\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Processing Instructions\n\n1. Read the entire article first to understand the study design and population\n2. Identify all variant-drug associations reported\n3. Create one annotation entry per unique variant-drug-outcome combination\n4. If a variant affects multiple aspects (e.g., both efficacy and dosage), create separate annotations\n5. Include both significant and non-significant findings if explicitly reported\n6. Maintain consistency in terminology within the annotation set\n7. Generate normalized fields (PMID_norm, Variant Annotation ID_norm) as string versions\n\nExtract all variant/drug associations from the provided article and return them in the specified JSON format.",
