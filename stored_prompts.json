Focus on identifying genetic associations with drug dosing, efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters.\n\n## Output Format\nGenerate a JSON object with a \"var_drug_ann\" array containing annotation objects. Each annotation should capture a specific variant-drug association reported in the article.\n\n## Schema Field Definitions\n\n### Core Identification Fields:\n- **Variant Annotation ID**: Generate a unique integer ID for each annotation\n- **Variant/Haplotypes**: The dbSNP rsID (e.g., rs9923231) or haplotype involved in the association\n- **Gene**: HGNC gene symbol (e.g., VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, UGT1A1)\n- **Drug(s)**: Generic drug name(s) involved in the association\n- **PMID**: PubMed ID from the article\n- **Phenotype Category**: Choose from: \"Dosage\", \"Efficacy\", \"Toxicity\", \"Metabolism/PK\", \"PD\", \"Other\"\n- **Significance**: Based on author's findings - \"yes\" (significant), \"no\" (not significant), or \"not stated\"\n\n### Detailed Annotation Fields:\n- **Notes**: Any relevant curator notes (e.g., \"alleles complemented to + strand\")\n- **Sentence**: A structured sentence describing the association (see template below)\n- **Alleles**: The specific alleles/genotypes being compared (e.g., \"CT + TT\", \"AC + CC\")\n- **Specialty Population**: Special populations if mentioned (e.g., \"pediatric\")\n\n### Sentence Component Fields:\n- **Metabolizer types**: Gene phenotype group if applicable (e.g., \"poor metabolizer\")\n- **isPlural**: \"Is\" or \"Are\" based on grammatical number\n- **Is/Is Not associated**: \"Associated with\" or \"Not associated with\"\n- **Direction of effect**: \"increased\" or \"decreased\" (null if not significant)\n- **PD/PK terms**: Pharmacological measure (e.g., \"dose of\", \"concentration of\", \"metabolism of\")\n- **Multiple drugs And/or**: \"and\" or \"or\" if multiple drugs listed\n- **Population types**: Study population descriptor (e.g., \"in people with\", \"in healthy individuals\")\n- **Population Phenotypes or diseases**: Specific conditions prefixed with \"Disease:\" (comma-separated)\n- **Multiple phenotypes or diseases And/or**: \"and\" or \"or\" for multiple conditions\n- **Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)**: Reference genotype/allele for comparison\n- **Comparison Metabolizer types**: Reference metabolizer phenotype if applicable\n\n## Sentence Template Pattern\nThe sentence should follow this structure:\n`[Alleles/Genotypes] [isPlural] [Is/Is Not associated] [Direction of effect] [PD/PK terms] [Drug(s)] [Population types] [Population Phenotypes or diseases] as compared to [Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)].`\n\nExample: \"Genotypes CT + TT are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary Embolism or Venous Thrombosis as compared to genotype CC.\"\n\n## Extraction Guidelines\n\n1. **Identify Key Findings**: Look for statements about genetic polymorphisms affecting drug response, particularly:\n   - Dose requirements\n   - Treatment efficacy\n   - Adverse effects/toxicity\n   - Drug metabolism rates\n\n2. **Statistical Significance**: \n   - Mark \"yes\" if p-value < 0.05 or authors state significance\n   - Mark \"no\" if explicitly stated as non-significant\n   - Use \"not stated\" if unclear\n\n3. **Direction of Effect**:\n   - \"increased\" = higher dose needed, increased risk, enhanced effect\n   - \"decreased\" = lower dose needed, reduced risk, diminished effect\n   - Leave null if no association found\n\n4. **Population Details**:\n   - Extract all mentioned conditions/diseases\n   - Use \"Disease:\" prefix for each condition\n   - Separate multiple conditions with commas\n   - Use \"and\"/\"or\" based on study design\n\n5. **Genotype Notation**:\n   - For SNPs: Use standard notation (e.g., CC, CT, TT)\n   - For star alleles: Use CYP notation (e.g., *1/*3)\n   - Combine multiple genotypes with \"+\"\n\n6. **Special Considerations**:\n   - If complemented to plus strand, note in \"Notes\" field\n   - Include all indications for drug use mentioned\n   - Preserve author's terminology for metabolizer phenotypes\n\n## Example Input/Output\n\n### Input Article Excerpt:\n\"The patients with variant genotypes of VKORC1 \u22121639G>A required significantly lower warfarin stable weekly doses than those with wild-type genotype (p < 0.001).

Read the entire article first to understand the study design and population\n2. Identify all variant-drug associations reported\n3. Create one annotation entry per unique variant-drug-outcome combination\n4. If a variant affects multiple aspects (e.g., both efficacy and dosage), create separate annotations\n5. Include both significant and non-significant findings if explicitly reported\n6. Maintain consistency in terminology within the annotation set\n7. Generate normalized fields (PMID_norm, Variant Annotation ID_norm) as string versions\n\nExtract all variant/drug associations from the provided article and return them in the specified JSON format.",

Your task is to carefully read a PubMed article and extract all statistical study parameters into a structured JSON format.\n\n## Output Format\n\nExtract data according to this JSON structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"study_parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"Study Parameters ID\": null,\n      \"Variant Annotation ID\": null,\n      \"Study Type\": null,\n      \"Study Cases\": null,\n      \"Study Controls\": null,\n      \"Characteristics\": \"\",\n      \"Characteristics Type\": \"\",\n      \"Frequency In Cases\": null,\n      \"Allele Of Frequency In Cases\": null,\n      \"Frequency In Controls\": null,\n      \"Allele Of Frequency In Controls\": null,\n      \"P Value\": \"\",\n      \"Ratio Stat Type\": \"\",\n      \"Ratio Stat\": null,\n      \"Confidence Interval Start\": null,\n      \"Confidence Interval Stop\": null,\n      \"Biogeographical Groups\": \"\",\n      \"Variant Annotation ID_norm\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Field Definitions and Extraction Guidelines\n\n### Study Parameters ID\n- Leave as `null` (will be assigned later)\n- Unique identifier for each study parameter entry\n\n### Variant Annotation ID\n- Leave as `null` (will be assigned later)\n- Links to variant annotation data\n\n### Study Type\n- Extract the type of study from methods/design sections\n- Valid values: \"cohort\", \"case/control\", \"case series\", \"cross-sectional\", \"clinical trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"GWAS\", \"replication\", \"prospective\", \"retrospective\", \"linkage\", \"trios\"\n- Use `null` if not clearly stated\n\n### Study Cases\n- Extract the number of participants/cases in the study or sub-cohort\n- Look for phrases like: \"n = 916\", \"780 users\", \"184 patients\"\n- Must be a number (can include decimal if reported)\n\n### Study Controls\n- Extract the number of controls used in association analysis\n- Only applicable for case-control studies\n- Use `null` if not a case-control design or not reported\n\n### Characteristics\n- **Critical field**: Free text describing the cohort or subgroup being analyzed\n- Look for:\n  - Drug names (e.g., \"Statin switch, simvastatin\", \"Statin switch, atorvastatin\")\n  - Disease conditions\n  - Age groups (e.g., \"Age > 65 years\")\n  - Gender specifications (e.g., \"Male patients\", \"Female patients\")\n  - Dose information if relevant to the cohort\n- Be specific and include all distinguishing details\n\n### Characteristics Type\n- Standardized category for the Characteristics field\n- Valid values: \"disease\", \"drug\", \"age group\", \"gender\", \"study cohort\", \"Study Cohort\"\n- Most pharmacogenetics studies use \"Study Cohort\" or \"drug\"\n\n### Frequency In Cases / Frequency In Controls\n- Extract allele frequencies if explicitly reported\n- Format: decimal number (e.g., 0.21, 0.043)\n- Look for phrases like: \"allele frequency was 0.21\", \"MAF = 0.15\"\n\n### Allele Of Frequency In Cases / Allele Of Frequency In Controls\n- The specific allele the frequency refers to\n- Format: single letter or variant notation (e.g., \"C\", \"T\", \"A\")\n\n### P Value\n- **Critical field**: Extract the p-value with its operator\n- Format: \"= 0.025\", \"< 0.001\", \"> 0.05\"\n- ALWAYS include the operator (=, <, >)\n- Look for: \"P = 0.025\", \"*P* = 0.011\", \"p-value = 0.047\"\n\n### Ratio Stat Type\n- Type of statistical ratio reported\n- Valid values: \"OR\" (odds ratio), \"RR\" (relative risk), \"HR\" (hazard ratio), \"Unknown\"\n- Look for: \"HR\", \"odds ratio\", \"relative risk\"\n- Use \"Unknown\" if a p-value is reported but no ratio type is specified\n\n### Ratio Stat\n- The numerical value of the ratio\n- Extract the point estimate: \"HR 1.88\" \u2192 1.88\n- Must be a number\n\n### Confidence Interval Start / Stop\n- Extract the confidence interval bounds\n- From \"95% CI 1.08\u20133.25\": Start = 1.08, Stop = 3.25\n- Watch for various notations: \"1.08-3.25\", \"1.08 to 3.25\", \"(1.08, 3.25)\"\n\n### Biogeographical Groups\n- Population ancestry/ethnicity of study participants\n- Valid values: \"African America/Afro-Caribbean\", \"American\", \"Central/South Asian\", \"East Asian\", \"European\", \"Latino\", \"Near Eastern\", \"Oceanian\", \"Sub-Saharan African\", \"Unknown\", \"Multiple Groups\"\n- \"Multiple Groups\" = study included participants from multiple populations\n- Look in Methods section for population description\n\n### Variant Annotation ID_norm\n- Leave as `null` (will be assigned later)\n\n## Extraction Strategy\n\n1. **Identify all statistical comparisons**: Look for hazard ratios, odds ratios, p-values, and confidence intervals in Results section\n\n2. **Create separate entries for each cohort/comparison**: If the study analyzes multiple drugs, genotypes, or subgroups, create a separate study parameter entry for each\n\n3. **Match statistics to cohorts**: Ensure each HR/OR/p-value is correctly associated with the right patient group or drug\n\n4. **Extract from Tables**: Statistical results are often in tables - extract each row as a separate entry\n\n5. **Handle multiple phenotypes**: If the study uses different outcome definitions (e.g., \"statin switch\" vs \"statin switch + CK measurement\"), create separate entries for each\n\n## Example Extraction\n\n**From the text:**\n\"We confirmed the association of SLCO1B1 c.521C/C genotype with simvastatin intolerance both by using phenotype of switching initial statin to another as a marker of statin intolerance [hazard ratio (HR) 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08\u20133.25, P = 0.025] and statin switching along with creatine kinase measurement (HR 5.44, 95% CI 1.49\u201319.9, P = 0.011).\"\n\n**Study context:**\n- 916 simvastatin users (European population)\n- Cohort study design\n\n**Extract as TWO entries:**\n\nEntry 1:\n```json\n{\n  \"Study Parameters ID\": null,\n  \"Variant Annotation ID\": null,\n  \"Study Type\": null,\n  \"Study Cases\": 916.0,\n  \"Study Controls\": null,\n  \"Characteristics\": \"Statin switch\",\n  \"Characteristics Type\": \"Study Cohort\",\n  \"Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"P Value\": \"= 0.025\",\n  \"Ratio Stat Type\": \"HR\",\n  \"Ratio Stat\": 1.88,\n  \"Confidence Interval Start\": 1.08,\n  \"Confidence Interval Stop\": 3.25,\n  \"Biogeographical Groups\": \"European\",\n  \"Variant Annotation ID_norm\": null\n}\n```\n\nEntry 2:\n```json\n{\n  \"Study Parameters ID\": null,\n  \"Variant Annotation ID\": null,\n  \"Study Type\": null,\n  \"Study Cases\": 916.0,\n  \"Study Controls\": null,\n  \"Characteristics\": \"Statin switch\",\n  \"Characteristics Type\": \"Study Cohort\",\n  \"Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"P Value\": \"= 0.011\",\n  \"Ratio Stat Type\": \"HR\",\n  \"Ratio Stat\": 5.44,\n  \"Confidence Interval Start\": 1.49,\n  \"Confidence Interval Stop\": 19.9,\n  \"Biogeographical Groups\": \"European\",\n  \"Variant Annotation ID_norm\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore submitting your extraction:\n- [ ] Each statistical result has its own entry\n- [ ] P Values include operators (=, <, >)\n- [ ] Confidence intervals are paired correctly (start < stop)\n- [ ] Study Cases numbers are extracted for each cohort\n- [ ] Characteristics describe what makes each cohort unique\n- [ ] All null values are explicitly set to `null`, not empty strings\n- [ ] Biogeographical Groups use exact terminology from the valid values list\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't merge multiple comparisons** - Each HR/OR/RR with its p-value should be a separate entry\n2. **Don't forget the operator in P Values** - Always include =, <, or >\n3. **Don't confuse cohort size** - For sub-analyses (e.g., \"780 atorvastatin users\"), use 780, not the total study N\n4. **Don't use empty strings for missing data** - Use `null` for numeric and null/empty fields\n5. **Don't modify Characteristics text** - Extract as written, maintaining drug names, doses, and descriptions\n\n## Now Extract\n\nRead the provided PubMed article carefully and extract all study parameters following the above guidelines. Return only the JSON output with all extracted entries.",

    "output": "This study evaluated the contribution of rare DPYD variants to interindividual variability in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DPYD exons and flanking splice junctions in 2,972 patients with pretreatment DPD phenotyping by the plasma dihydrouracil/uracil ([UH2]/[U]) ratio. Known high-impact alleles (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T) were confirmed to associate strongly with low DPD activity, and several common variants (including haplotype B3) showed modest effects. Importantly, rare variants (MAF <1%) were significantly enriched among patients with partial DPD deficiency (9.3% vs 3.2%, P < 1e-5), and predicted deleterious rare variants (CADD >15) remained more frequent in the low-activity group (4.2% vs 1.6%, P < 0.001), indicating rare alleles account for a sizable fraction of functional variability. The authors conclude that comprehensive NGS-based DPYD genotyping, alongside phenotyping, could improve pre-emptive identification of patients at risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity; a limitation is the lack of direct clinical toxicity outcomes in this cohort.",
