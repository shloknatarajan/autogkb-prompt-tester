They are used both in primary and secondary prevention to reduce cardiovascular risk. Even though statins are generally well tolerated, their most typical adverse effects include muscular toxicity ranging from relatively common muscle pain (myalgia) to very rare but potentially life-threatening rhabdomyolysis [[1](#R1)]. Statin-induced muscle toxicity is a dose- and concentration-dependent phenomenon [[2](#R2),[3](#R3)], and several predisposing factors due to increased statin concentrations have been identified, including drug-drug interactions and genetic factors [[4](#R4)\u2013[7](#R7)].\n\nStatins are similar in their pharmacodynamic effects, but their pharmacokinetic properties exhibit significant differences [[8](#R8),[9](#R9)]. Simvastatin and lovastatin are administered as inactive lactones and are converted to an active acid form, whereas other statins in clinical use (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) are administered in the active acid form. The main clearance mechanism for the more lipophilic statins is oxidative biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) and CYP2C9 (fluvastatin), whereas the more hydrophilic statins (pitavastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin) are excreted mainly unchanged. Furthermore, all statins are transported by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (encoded by *SLCO1B1*) and atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, encoded by *ABCG2*) [[5](#R5),[8](#R8),[10](#R10)]. Accordingly, genetic variability affecting the function of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can have a profound impact on statin pharmacokinetics, translating into altered risk for concentration-dependent adverse effects between individuals at equal doses.\n\nA recently published Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline on the pharmacogenetics of statin-induced muscle symptoms provided therapeutic recommendations for statins based on *SLCO1B1, ABCG2*, and *CYP2C9* genotypes [[11](#R11)]. Simvastatin acid is among the most sensitive drugs to alterations in *SLCO1B1* genotype [[5](#R5),[6](#R6),[12](#R12)\u2013[14](#R14)]. Moreover, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C has been consistently associated with simvastatin and atorvastatin-induced myopathy and intolerance, especially when high doses are used [[5](#R5),[7](#R7),[12](#R12)\u2013[17](#R17)]. Although the pharmacokinetic effects are clear, the clinical evidence linking genetic variants in other pharmacokinetic genes as well as statins other than simvastatin and atorvastatin with statin intolerance is sparse. Thus, we sought to study the effects of *SLCO1B1, ABCG2* and *CYP2C9* genotypes on statin intolerance in a large cohort of incident statin users linked to biobank and national register data.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and data sources\n\nThis was a register-based cohort study linking data from the Helsinki Biobank with Finnish national health registries to investigate pharmacogenomics of statins. Helsinki Biobank identified eligible individuals (see Study population). Information on drug purchases was collected from the drug reimbursement registry maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). The registry contains the identification code for drug purchased (ATC code), the date of purchase, the purchased amount in milligrams, the size of the package, and number of packages purchased covering all residents in Finland. In addition to first statin purchase, all subsequent statin purchases were collected from the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2016. Information about plasma creatine kinase (CK) measurements and date of measurements, was provided by Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory Services (HUSLAB). Helsinki Biobank linked information from these sources with pseudonymized identifiers assigned to every individual in the study. The biobank also provided pseudonymized DNA samples from all subjects for genotyping.\n\n### Study population\n\nThe study population consisted of patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. Individuals fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were included in the study: (1) at least one purchase of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin during the period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2016, (2) no purchase of a statin during 1997 and (3) a signed biobank consent and a DNA sample available in the Helsinki Biobank for analysis. Pitavastatin and lovastatin were not included because pitavastatin is not available in Finland and lovastatin usage is minimal. The first statin purchased by the study patient was defined as the index statin. Individuals were excluded from analysis based on the following criteria: (1) index statin was a simvastatin and ezetimibe combination product, (2) index statin was atorvastatin or rosuvastatin which was switched to another statin between May 2006 and April 2007 or (3) missing relevant genotype data. The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective. This led to excessive number of switches unrelated to statin intolerance from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to other statins between May 2006 and April 2007. One subject withdrew the biobank consent during the study and was excluded from the analyses. Follow-up started from the first purchase of the index statin and the study patients were censored from the analyses when they had no subsequent statin purchases during 365 days, they died, or the follow-up time ended (31 December 2016). Daily statin dose was assumed to be one unit per day [[18](#R18)].\n\n### Statin intolerance phenotypes\n\nPrimary statin intolerance phenotype was defined as a switch to another statin from the initially purchased index statin. Intolerance event date was defined as the last purchase date of the index statin before the switch. ATC code was used as an identifier for the drug used and thus change to another brand was not considered as a statin switch. Secondary intolerance phenotype was switch as defined in the primary intolerance phenotype combined with temporal relation to CK value measurement. Temporal relation was defined as CK measurement occurring within a period of 30 days before to 90 days after the intolerance event date. The CK measurement was considered as a binary outcome and the numeric value of the CK measurement was not considered in the analyses. Each intolerance phenotype was only analyzed if there were more than 10 occurrences of the phenotype for an index statin. Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) was used for defining the statin intolerance phenotypes.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nDNA samples were provided by the Helsinki Biobank at the concentration of 50 ng/\u00b5l. The participants were genotyped for the *ABCG2* rs2231142 (c.421C>A, p.Gln141Lys), *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 (c.521T>C, p.Val174Ala), and the *CYP2C9* rs1799853 (c.430C>T, p.Arg144Cys, **2*) and rs1057910 (c.1075A>G, p.Ile359Leu, **3*) single nucleotide variations (SNV) using TaqMan genotyping assays on OpenArray plates and the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Genotyping results were interpreted using TaqMan Genotyper Software v.1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for *CYP2C9*2* or **3* were classified as poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (PM), heterozygotes as intermediate metabolizers, and non-carriers as normal metabolizers.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nCox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate possible associations of genetic variants with the occurrence of the statin intolerance phenotypes. Daily statin doses were set as covariates in the analyses as categorical variables. Genotypes were analyzed as categorical variables using an additive model. In case the variant homozygous genotype group or the lowest or highest dose group contained less than 10 individuals, the group was joined with the adjacent group. The comparisons were carried out for individual SNVs, CYP2C9 metabolizer classes, or for the numbers of risk, that is, variant alleles in the candidate genes for a specific statin including the statin dose in the model. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium *P*-values were approximated with 10 000 permutations. The statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) and JMP Genomics 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).\n\n### Ethical aspects\n\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa approved the study (HUS/2926/2017). Permission to use the data and samples was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS/359/2017) and permissions to use the prescription data were obtained from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela 9/522/2018) and the clinical chemistry data from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL/161/5.05.00/2018). The research permit was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS 32/2018). After record linkage in the Helsinki Biobank, the data was provided to the study group in a pseudonymized form. The patients had given informed consent to Helsinki Biobank for their samples and data to be used for research purposes as defined in the Finnish Biobank Act.\n\n## Results\n\nData and DNA samples were obtained from 2242 biobank consented patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016 (Fig. [1](#F1)). A total of 200 patients were excluded from analysis due to one of the following reasons: withdrawal of biobank consent (n = 1), a fixed-dose simvastatin-ezetimibe combination as the index therapy (n = 2), unsuccessful genotyping of relevant variants (n = 68), or switch from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to another statin in the time between May 2006 and April 2007 (n = 129). The final study sample consisted of 2042 participants of whom 1073 (52.5%) were women. Their mean \u00b1 SD age was 60 \u00b1 11.8 years. Genotyping call rate ranged between 0.94 and 0.99 and the observed genotype frequencies were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table [1](#T1)). The observed minor allele frequencies were nearly identical to those observed in the Finnish population previously but differed slightly from previous data in the European population [[19](#R19),[20](#R20)].\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9549/10399933/9200564d7f77/pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10399933_pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\nData collection process, exclusions, and distribution of participants according to the statin initiated. *The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Gene | rsID | Nucleotide change | Amino acid change | Heterozygotes | Homozygotes | HWE, P-value | Call rate | MAF present study | MAF Finnisha | MAF Europeansb |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ABCG2 | rs2231142 | c.421C>A | p.Gln141Lys | 0.13 | 0.007 | 0.26 | 0.99 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.08 |\n| SLCO1B1 | rs4149056 | c.521T>C | p.Val174Ala | 0.32 | 0.043 | 0.65 | 0.97 | 0.20 | 0.21 | 0.16 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1799853 | c.430C>T | p.Arg144Cys | 0.19 | 0.016 | 0.08 | 0.94 | 0.11 | 0.11 | 0.12 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1057910 | c.1075A>G | p.Ile359Leu | 0.12 | 0.003 | 0.71 | 0.98 | 0.06 | 0.06 | 0.07 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Investigated single nucleotide variants and their frequencies among the 2241 Finnish patients\n\n### Simvastatin\n\nThe median follow-up time for simvastatin initiators was 532 days.

The effect was consistent in both of our intolerance phenotypes, the first based on statin switching only and the second based on statin switching and temporally associated CK measurement. By using these statin intolerance phenotypes, we also found a significant association of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with pravastatin intolerance.\n\nMajority of real-world evidence linking genetic factors with statin intolerance is based on either simvastatin users or at least a majority of simvastatin users due to historically widespread use of simvastatin in favor of other statins. Genetic association studies have rarely stratified for statin type in the primary analyses, in many cases due to insufficient sample size for statins other than simvastatin and in some cases atorvastatin [[11](#R11),[16](#R16)]. As the pharmacokinetics of statins differ from each other, we found it important, however, to stratify in the primary analyses by statin type in statin-na\u00efve statin initiators. Otherwise, possible associations could be diluted by differences in metabolic and disposition pathways of different statins. For example, common *SLCO1B1* and *ABCG2* variants differentially affect pharmacokinetics of specific statins [[6](#R6),[21](#R21)\u2013[28](#R28)]. Moreover, simvastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4/5, and fluvastatin is metabolized by the genetically polymorphic CYP2C9 [[9](#R9),[25](#R25),[28](#R28)\u2013[31](#R31)]. A tradeoff of this choice is that we could not account for multiple switches for individual subjects.\n\nDue to the epidemiological nature of our study, the definitions for statin intolerance were based on prescribing patterns (statin switching) or combination of prescribing patterns with clinical chemistry measurements (CK measurements) indicative of intolerance to statin therapy. Our definitions differed somewhat from similar previous studies based on electronic medical records without information about patient-reported symptoms for intolerance [[32](#R32),[33](#R33)]. We included only statin switching in our phenotype, since in our preliminary analyses with simvastatin-*SLCO1B1* statin switching rather than statin discontinuation or statin dose reduction, best-represented statin intolerance. This choice can be rationalized by the fact that statin discontinuation and dose reduction can occur for multitude of reasons not related to intolerance, which are not possible to be identified from the administrative registry data without access to electronic health records. Thus, statin switching is more likely to represent general statin intolerance but it can also be related to lack of efficacy. Consequently, we found it important to include an intolerance phenotype where change in statin prescribing was temporally associated with another indicator for intolerance, namely a CK measurement. Even though CK measurement can be ordered in various clinical situations, it is typically measured when statin-induced myopathy is suspected. Furthermore, muscle symptoms without CK elevation are a much more common form of statin-related myotoxicity than muscle symptoms with CK elevation [[1](#R1)]. Therefore, we included any CK measurement regardless of result to include also milder cases of myalgia not associated with CK increase. However, it should be noted that in the double-blinded STOMP trial, 9.4% of subjects treated with high dose atorvastatin experienced myalgia, whereas 4.6% of those treated with placebo experienced myalgia even after rechallenge [[34](#R34)]. Thus, our latter phenotype is more likely to represent muscle symptom-based statin intolerance, even though it might not be possible to separate between true statin-induced myalgia and symptoms unrelated to statins. The interval of 365 days between statin purchases for censoring was chosen to be able to catch statin switches after a pause of the initial statin. Our statin intolerance phenotype definitions were corroborated by robust associations of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with both intolerance phenotypes in simvastatin users.\n\nIn addition to simvastatin, we observed that heterozygous or homozygous *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C carriers had a higher risk of pravastatin intolerance based on statin switching phenotype when compared to reference allele homozygotes. It is noteworthy that the effect was observed in our cohort with low-moderate pravastatin doses as 40 mg is the highest approved dose of pravastatin in Europe rather than 80 mg available in the USA. In a previous pharmacogenetic study of statin efficacy and safety, 143 patients received 10 mg/day pravastatin for 8 weeks followed by 40 mg/day for 8 weeks [[16](#R16)]. Of these patients, 31 experienced a composite adverse event of either premature discontinuation due to any side effect, myalgia, or muscle cramps, or CK elevation during the 16-week follow-up. The *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV showed no association with the composite adverse event. The median follow-up time in our study was more than 2 years in pravastatin initiators, which may partly explain the differing results. Although most statin-induced muscle symptoms occur during the first months of statin usage, myotoxicity can occur even years after statin initiation [[7](#R7)].\n\nWe observed no statistically significant increase in statin intolerance risk for atorvastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin with the studied genotypes. For atorvastatin, no signals were evident for genotype-driven increased risk in our cohort of 780 atorvastatin users who most often had 10 and 20 mg prescribed as a starting dose. An earlier meta-analysis of 13 studies with a total of 1550 patients found that the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV associates with atorvastatin-induced adverse effects [[15](#R15)]. Moreover, in two recent prospective observational studies with substantial sample sizes (870 and 1627), the SNV was associated with an increased risk of atorvastatin intolerance or atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms [[17](#R17),[32](#R32)]. In the former study, 90% of the patients were using 80 mg/day atorvastatin, which is a substantially higher proportion than in our study and may partly explain the differing results. Nevertheless, the non-significant HR of 1.25 to 1.3 for the statin switch + CK measurement phenotype in C-allele carriers in our study is close to the odds ratio of 1.44 for atorvastatin intolerance and HR of 1.4 for atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms in the previous studies [[11](#R11)\u2013[13](#R13),[17](#R17),[35](#R35)].\n\nThe rosuvastatin cohort consisted of only 184 patients who had most often 5 or 10 mg prescribed starting dose with no tendencies for increased risk in carriers of the candidate risk alleles. The findings are in line with the JUPITER trial in which the *SLCO1B1* genotype was not associated with clinically reported myalgia in a clinical trial setting with rosuvastatin dose of 20 mg [[36](#R36)]. The median follow-up time for rosuvastatin was relatively short, due to a recent increase in its use. This may diminish the sensitivity to identify genotype-intolerance associations.\n\nFor fluvastatin, there was a trend towards increased risk of statin intolerance with a point estimate of HR at 1.88 in carriers of 2\u20134 risk alleles, but perhaps due to low sample size, the finding was not statistically significant. A previous study in renal transplant recipients with 52 cases of fluvastatin-induced adverse muscular or liver symptoms and 52 matched controls, showed that the *CYP2C9*2* and **3* alleles and the *ABCG2* c.421C>A SNV significantly increase the risk of these adverse reactions, with odds ratios between 2.4 and 6.6 [[37](#R37)]. Our data suggest that these alleles as well as the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV may increase the risk of fluvastatin intolerance also among general hypercholesterolemic patients, but further studies are required to confirm the findings.\n\nOur study has some limitations mainly related to its epidemiological and retrospective nature. Obviously, some prescribing changes occurring in our study are not related to statin intolerance and cases of true intolerance cannot be identified from the data. In any case, the study answers the clinical question of how the studied genotypes are related to statin switching. Furthermore, we eliminated obvious causes of confounding in prescribing patterns due to administrative factors by excluding time frames where atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were switched to other statins due to changes in reimbursement policies. The study population consisted of biobank-consented patients with available DNA samples who initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. As the Helsinki Biobank became operational in 2015, the majority of the study subjects had initiated their statin therapy before giving biobank consent and samples to the biobank, presenting a possibility for immortal time bias. For the current study design, this is not of major concern, however, as the study outcome was not related to survival. Moreover, the genotype frequencies observed were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and match those reported for the Finnish population (Table [1](#T1)). Lastly, due to low sample size in the fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin cohorts, care is warranted in making conclusions based on the current study alone.\n\nThe current study has several clinical implications. First, it corroborates the well-characterized association of *SLCO1B1* genotype with simvastatin intolerance in a real-world setting. Second, despite limited numbers, the *SLCO1B1* genotype associated with pravastatin intolerance at a dose range of 20\u201340 mg, supporting the role of OATP1B1 activity in pravastatin adverse effects. Third, even though no statistically significant genotype associations were observed for atorvastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin, these results can be used in future meta-analyses and in compilation of clinically actionable pharmacogenetic guidelines.\n\nIn conclusion, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C genotype was associated with increased switching of simvastatin and pravastatin to other statins in an epidemiological biobank study. The intolerance phenotype derived from statin switching alone or combined with CK measurement appears to be suitable to evaluate statin intolerance. Further studies in larger populations are required to examine the pharmacogenetics of statin intolerance.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all study participants for their participation in the biobank research and the Helsinki Biobank for establishing the study cohort.\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the European Research Council (Grant agreement 725249), State funding for university-level health research, and the Sigrid Jus\u00e9lius Foundation (Helsinki, Finland).\n\n### Conflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n1.

They are used both in primary and secondary prevention to reduce cardiovascular risk. Even though statins are generally well tolerated, their most typical adverse effects include muscular toxicity ranging from relatively common muscle pain (myalgia) to very rare but potentially life-threatening rhabdomyolysis [[1](#R1)]. Statin-induced muscle toxicity is a dose- and concentration-dependent phenomenon [[2](#R2),[3](#R3)], and several predisposing factors due to increased statin concentrations have been identified, including drug-drug interactions and genetic factors [[4](#R4)\u2013[7](#R7)].\n\nStatins are similar in their pharmacodynamic effects, but their pharmacokinetic properties exhibit significant differences [[8](#R8),[9](#R9)]. Simvastatin and lovastatin are administered as inactive lactones and are converted to an active acid form, whereas other statins in clinical use (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) are administered in the active acid form. The main clearance mechanism for the more lipophilic statins is oxidative biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) and CYP2C9 (fluvastatin), whereas the more hydrophilic statins (pitavastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin) are excreted mainly unchanged. Furthermore, all statins are transported by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (encoded by *SLCO1B1*) and atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, encoded by *ABCG2*) [[5](#R5),[8](#R8),[10](#R10)]. Accordingly, genetic variability affecting the function of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can have a profound impact on statin pharmacokinetics, translating into altered risk for concentration-dependent adverse effects between individuals at equal doses.\n\nA recently published Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline on the pharmacogenetics of statin-induced muscle symptoms provided therapeutic recommendations for statins based on *SLCO1B1, ABCG2*, and *CYP2C9* genotypes [[11](#R11)]. Simvastatin acid is among the most sensitive drugs to alterations in *SLCO1B1* genotype [[5](#R5),[6](#R6),[12](#R12)\u2013[14](#R14)]. Moreover, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C has been consistently associated with simvastatin and atorvastatin-induced myopathy and intolerance, especially when high doses are used [[5](#R5),[7](#R7),[12](#R12)\u2013[17](#R17)]. Although the pharmacokinetic effects are clear, the clinical evidence linking genetic variants in other pharmacokinetic genes as well as statins other than simvastatin and atorvastatin with statin intolerance is sparse. Thus, we sought to study the effects of *SLCO1B1, ABCG2* and *CYP2C9* genotypes on statin intolerance in a large cohort of incident statin users linked to biobank and national register data.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and data sources\n\nThis was a register-based cohort study linking data from the Helsinki Biobank with Finnish national health registries to investigate pharmacogenomics of statins. Helsinki Biobank identified eligible individuals (see Study population). Information on drug purchases was collected from the drug reimbursement registry maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). The registry contains the identification code for drug purchased (ATC code), the date of purchase, the purchased amount in milligrams, the size of the package, and number of packages purchased covering all residents in Finland. In addition to first statin purchase, all subsequent statin purchases were collected from the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2016. Information about plasma creatine kinase (CK) measurements and date of measurements, was provided by Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory Services (HUSLAB). Helsinki Biobank linked information from these sources with pseudonymized identifiers assigned to every individual in the study. The biobank also provided pseudonymized DNA samples from all subjects for genotyping.\n\n### Study population\n\nThe study population consisted of patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. Individuals fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were included in the study: (1) at least one purchase of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin during the period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2016, (2) no purchase of a statin during 1997 and (3) a signed biobank consent and a DNA sample available in the Helsinki Biobank for analysis. Pitavastatin and lovastatin were not included because pitavastatin is not available in Finland and lovastatin usage is minimal. The first statin purchased by the study patient was defined as the index statin. Individuals were excluded from analysis based on the following criteria: (1) index statin was a simvastatin and ezetimibe combination product, (2) index statin was atorvastatin or rosuvastatin which was switched to another statin between May 2006 and April 2007 or (3) missing relevant genotype data. The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective. This led to excessive number of switches unrelated to statin intolerance from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to other statins between May 2006 and April 2007. One subject withdrew the biobank consent during the study and was excluded from the analyses. Follow-up started from the first purchase of the index statin and the study patients were censored from the analyses when they had no subsequent statin purchases during 365 days, they died, or the follow-up time ended (31 December 2016). Daily statin dose was assumed to be one unit per day [[18](#R18)].\n\n### Statin intolerance phenotypes\n\nPrimary statin intolerance phenotype was defined as a switch to another statin from the initially purchased index statin. Intolerance event date was defined as the last purchase date of the index statin before the switch. ATC code was used as an identifier for the drug used and thus change to another brand was not considered as a statin switch. Secondary intolerance phenotype was switch as defined in the primary intolerance phenotype combined with temporal relation to CK value measurement. Temporal relation was defined as CK measurement occurring within a period of 30 days before to 90 days after the intolerance event date. The CK measurement was considered as a binary outcome and the numeric value of the CK measurement was not considered in the analyses. Each intolerance phenotype was only analyzed if there were more than 10 occurrences of the phenotype for an index statin. Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) was used for defining the statin intolerance phenotypes.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nDNA samples were provided by the Helsinki Biobank at the concentration of 50 ng/\u00b5l. The participants were genotyped for the *ABCG2* rs2231142 (c.421C>A, p.Gln141Lys), *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 (c.521T>C, p.Val174Ala), and the *CYP2C9* rs1799853 (c.430C>T, p.Arg144Cys, **2*) and rs1057910 (c.1075A>G, p.Ile359Leu, **3*) single nucleotide variations (SNV) using TaqMan genotyping assays on OpenArray plates and the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Genotyping results were interpreted using TaqMan Genotyper Software v.1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for *CYP2C9*2* or **3* were classified as poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (PM), heterozygotes as intermediate metabolizers, and non-carriers as normal metabolizers.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nCox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate possible associations of genetic variants with the occurrence of the statin intolerance phenotypes. Daily statin doses were set as covariates in the analyses as categorical variables. Genotypes were analyzed as categorical variables using an additive model. In case the variant homozygous genotype group or the lowest or highest dose group contained less than 10 individuals, the group was joined with the adjacent group. The comparisons were carried out for individual SNVs, CYP2C9 metabolizer classes, or for the numbers of risk, that is, variant alleles in the candidate genes for a specific statin including the statin dose in the model. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium *P*-values were approximated with 10 000 permutations. The statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) and JMP Genomics 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).\n\n### Ethical aspects\n\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa approved the study (HUS/2926/2017). Permission to use the data and samples was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS/359/2017) and permissions to use the prescription data were obtained from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela 9/522/2018) and the clinical chemistry data from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL/161/5.05.00/2018). The research permit was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS 32/2018). After record linkage in the Helsinki Biobank, the data was provided to the study group in a pseudonymized form. The patients had given informed consent to Helsinki Biobank for their samples and data to be used for research purposes as defined in the Finnish Biobank Act.\n\n## Results\n\nData and DNA samples were obtained from 2242 biobank consented patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016 (Fig. [1](#F1)). A total of 200 patients were excluded from analysis due to one of the following reasons: withdrawal of biobank consent (n = 1), a fixed-dose simvastatin-ezetimibe combination as the index therapy (n = 2), unsuccessful genotyping of relevant variants (n = 68), or switch from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to another statin in the time between May 2006 and April 2007 (n = 129). The final study sample consisted of 2042 participants of whom 1073 (52.5%) were women. Their mean \u00b1 SD age was 60 \u00b1 11.8 years. Genotyping call rate ranged between 0.94 and 0.99 and the observed genotype frequencies were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table [1](#T1)). The observed minor allele frequencies were nearly identical to those observed in the Finnish population previously but differed slightly from previous data in the European population [[19](#R19),[20](#R20)].\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9549/10399933/9200564d7f77/pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10399933_pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\nData collection process, exclusions, and distribution of participants according to the statin initiated. *The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Gene | rsID | Nucleotide change | Amino acid change | Heterozygotes | Homozygotes | HWE, P-value | Call rate | MAF present study | MAF Finnisha | MAF Europeansb |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ABCG2 | rs2231142 | c.421C>A | p.Gln141Lys | 0.13 | 0.007 | 0.26 | 0.99 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.08 |\n| SLCO1B1 | rs4149056 | c.521T>C | p.Val174Ala | 0.32 | 0.043 | 0.65 | 0.97 | 0.20 | 0.21 | 0.16 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1799853 | c.430C>T | p.Arg144Cys | 0.19 | 0.016 | 0.08 | 0.94 | 0.11 | 0.11 | 0.12 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1057910 | c.1075A>G | p.Ile359Leu | 0.12 | 0.003 | 0.71 | 0.98 | 0.06 | 0.06 | 0.07 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Investigated single nucleotide variants and their frequencies among the 2241 Finnish patients\n\n### Simvastatin\n\nThe median follow-up time for simvastatin initiators was 532 days.

The effect was consistent in both of our intolerance phenotypes, the first based on statin switching only and the second based on statin switching and temporally associated CK measurement. By using these statin intolerance phenotypes, we also found a significant association of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with pravastatin intolerance.\n\nMajority of real-world evidence linking genetic factors with statin intolerance is based on either simvastatin users or at least a majority of simvastatin users due to historically widespread use of simvastatin in favor of other statins. Genetic association studies have rarely stratified for statin type in the primary analyses, in many cases due to insufficient sample size for statins other than simvastatin and in some cases atorvastatin [[11](#R11),[16](#R16)]. As the pharmacokinetics of statins differ from each other, we found it important, however, to stratify in the primary analyses by statin type in statin-na\u00efve statin initiators. Otherwise, possible associations could be diluted by differences in metabolic and disposition pathways of different statins. For example, common *SLCO1B1* and *ABCG2* variants differentially affect pharmacokinetics of specific statins [[6](#R6),[21](#R21)\u2013[28](#R28)]. Moreover, simvastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4/5, and fluvastatin is metabolized by the genetically polymorphic CYP2C9 [[9](#R9),[25](#R25),[28](#R28)\u2013[31](#R31)]. A tradeoff of this choice is that we could not account for multiple switches for individual subjects.\n\nDue to the epidemiological nature of our study, the definitions for statin intolerance were based on prescribing patterns (statin switching) or combination of prescribing patterns with clinical chemistry measurements (CK measurements) indicative of intolerance to statin therapy. Our definitions differed somewhat from similar previous studies based on electronic medical records without information about patient-reported symptoms for intolerance [[32](#R32),[33](#R33)]. We included only statin switching in our phenotype, since in our preliminary analyses with simvastatin-*SLCO1B1* statin switching rather than statin discontinuation or statin dose reduction, best-represented statin intolerance. This choice can be rationalized by the fact that statin discontinuation and dose reduction can occur for multitude of reasons not related to intolerance, which are not possible to be identified from the administrative registry data without access to electronic health records. Thus, statin switching is more likely to represent general statin intolerance but it can also be related to lack of efficacy. Consequently, we found it important to include an intolerance phenotype where change in statin prescribing was temporally associated with another indicator for intolerance, namely a CK measurement. Even though CK measurement can be ordered in various clinical situations, it is typically measured when statin-induced myopathy is suspected. Furthermore, muscle symptoms without CK elevation are a much more common form of statin-related myotoxicity than muscle symptoms with CK elevation [[1](#R1)]. Therefore, we included any CK measurement regardless of result to include also milder cases of myalgia not associated with CK increase. However, it should be noted that in the double-blinded STOMP trial, 9.4% of subjects treated with high dose atorvastatin experienced myalgia, whereas 4.6% of those treated with placebo experienced myalgia even after rechallenge [[34](#R34)]. Thus, our latter phenotype is more likely to represent muscle symptom-based statin intolerance, even though it might not be possible to separate between true statin-induced myalgia and symptoms unrelated to statins. The interval of 365 days between statin purchases for censoring was chosen to be able to catch statin switches after a pause of the initial statin. Our statin intolerance phenotype definitions were corroborated by robust associations of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with both intolerance phenotypes in simvastatin users.\n\nIn addition to simvastatin, we observed that heterozygous or homozygous *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C carriers had a higher risk of pravastatin intolerance based on statin switching phenotype when compared to reference allele homozygotes. It is noteworthy that the effect was observed in our cohort with low-moderate pravastatin doses as 40 mg is the highest approved dose of pravastatin in Europe rather than 80 mg available in the USA. In a previous pharmacogenetic study of statin efficacy and safety, 143 patients received 10 mg/day pravastatin for 8 weeks followed by 40 mg/day for 8 weeks [[16](#R16)]. Of these patients, 31 experienced a composite adverse event of either premature discontinuation due to any side effect, myalgia, or muscle cramps, or CK elevation during the 16-week follow-up. The *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV showed no association with the composite adverse event. The median follow-up time in our study was more than 2 years in pravastatin initiators, which may partly explain the differing results. Although most statin-induced muscle symptoms occur during the first months of statin usage, myotoxicity can occur even years after statin initiation [[7](#R7)].\n\nWe observed no statistically significant increase in statin intolerance risk for atorvastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin with the studied genotypes. For atorvastatin, no signals were evident for genotype-driven increased risk in our cohort of 780 atorvastatin users who most often had 10 and 20 mg prescribed as a starting dose. An earlier meta-analysis of 13 studies with a total of 1550 patients found that the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV associates with atorvastatin-induced adverse effects [[15](#R15)]. Moreover, in two recent prospective observational studies with substantial sample sizes (870 and 1627), the SNV was associated with an increased risk of atorvastatin intolerance or atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms [[17](#R17),[32](#R32)]. In the former study, 90% of the patients were using 80 mg/day atorvastatin, which is a substantially higher proportion than in our study and may partly explain the differing results. Nevertheless, the non-significant HR of 1.25 to 1.3 for the statin switch + CK measurement phenotype in C-allele carriers in our study is close to the odds ratio of 1.44 for atorvastatin intolerance and HR of 1.4 for atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms in the previous studies [[11](#R11)\u2013[13](#R13),[17](#R17),[35](#R35)].\n\nThe rosuvastatin cohort consisted of only 184 patients who had most often 5 or 10 mg prescribed starting dose with no tendencies for increased risk in carriers of the candidate risk alleles. The findings are in line with the JUPITER trial in which the *SLCO1B1* genotype was not associated with clinically reported myalgia in a clinical trial setting with rosuvastatin dose of 20 mg [[36](#R36)]. The median follow-up time for rosuvastatin was relatively short, due to a recent increase in its use. This may diminish the sensitivity to identify genotype-intolerance associations.\n\nFor fluvastatin, there was a trend towards increased risk of statin intolerance with a point estimate of HR at 1.88 in carriers of 2\u20134 risk alleles, but perhaps due to low sample size, the finding was not statistically significant. A previous study in renal transplant recipients with 52 cases of fluvastatin-induced adverse muscular or liver symptoms and 52 matched controls, showed that the *CYP2C9*2* and **3* alleles and the *ABCG2* c.421C>A SNV significantly increase the risk of these adverse reactions, with odds ratios between 2.4 and 6.6 [[37](#R37)]. Our data suggest that these alleles as well as the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV may increase the risk of fluvastatin intolerance also among general hypercholesterolemic patients, but further studies are required to confirm the findings.\n\nOur study has some limitations mainly related to its epidemiological and retrospective nature. Obviously, some prescribing changes occurring in our study are not related to statin intolerance and cases of true intolerance cannot be identified from the data. In any case, the study answers the clinical question of how the studied genotypes are related to statin switching. Furthermore, we eliminated obvious causes of confounding in prescribing patterns due to administrative factors by excluding time frames where atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were switched to other statins due to changes in reimbursement policies. The study population consisted of biobank-consented patients with available DNA samples who initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. As the Helsinki Biobank became operational in 2015, the majority of the study subjects had initiated their statin therapy before giving biobank consent and samples to the biobank, presenting a possibility for immortal time bias. For the current study design, this is not of major concern, however, as the study outcome was not related to survival. Moreover, the genotype frequencies observed were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and match those reported for the Finnish population (Table [1](#T1)). Lastly, due to low sample size in the fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin cohorts, care is warranted in making conclusions based on the current study alone.\n\nThe current study has several clinical implications. First, it corroborates the well-characterized association of *SLCO1B1* genotype with simvastatin intolerance in a real-world setting. Second, despite limited numbers, the *SLCO1B1* genotype associated with pravastatin intolerance at a dose range of 20\u201340 mg, supporting the role of OATP1B1 activity in pravastatin adverse effects. Third, even though no statistically significant genotype associations were observed for atorvastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin, these results can be used in future meta-analyses and in compilation of clinically actionable pharmacogenetic guidelines.\n\nIn conclusion, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C genotype was associated with increased switching of simvastatin and pravastatin to other statins in an epidemiological biobank study. The intolerance phenotype derived from statin switching alone or combined with CK measurement appears to be suitable to evaluate statin intolerance. Further studies in larger populations are required to examine the pharmacogenetics of statin intolerance.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all study participants for their participation in the biobank research and the Helsinki Biobank for establishing the study cohort.\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the European Research Council (Grant agreement 725249), State funding for university-level health research, and the Sigrid Jus\u00e9lius Foundation (Helsinki, Finland).\n\n### Conflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n1.

They are used both in primary and secondary prevention to reduce cardiovascular risk. Even though statins are generally well tolerated, their most typical adverse effects include muscular toxicity ranging from relatively common muscle pain (myalgia) to very rare but potentially life-threatening rhabdomyolysis [[1](#R1)]. Statin-induced muscle toxicity is a dose- and concentration-dependent phenomenon [[2](#R2),[3](#R3)], and several predisposing factors due to increased statin concentrations have been identified, including drug-drug interactions and genetic factors [[4](#R4)\u2013[7](#R7)].\n\nStatins are similar in their pharmacodynamic effects, but their pharmacokinetic properties exhibit significant differences [[8](#R8),[9](#R9)]. Simvastatin and lovastatin are administered as inactive lactones and are converted to an active acid form, whereas other statins in clinical use (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) are administered in the active acid form. The main clearance mechanism for the more lipophilic statins is oxidative biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) and CYP2C9 (fluvastatin), whereas the more hydrophilic statins (pitavastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin) are excreted mainly unchanged. Furthermore, all statins are transported by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (encoded by *SLCO1B1*) and atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, encoded by *ABCG2*) [[5](#R5),[8](#R8),[10](#R10)]. Accordingly, genetic variability affecting the function of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can have a profound impact on statin pharmacokinetics, translating into altered risk for concentration-dependent adverse effects between individuals at equal doses.\n\nA recently published Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline on the pharmacogenetics of statin-induced muscle symptoms provided therapeutic recommendations for statins based on *SLCO1B1, ABCG2*, and *CYP2C9* genotypes [[11](#R11)]. Simvastatin acid is among the most sensitive drugs to alterations in *SLCO1B1* genotype [[5](#R5),[6](#R6),[12](#R12)\u2013[14](#R14)]. Moreover, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C has been consistently associated with simvastatin and atorvastatin-induced myopathy and intolerance, especially when high doses are used [[5](#R5),[7](#R7),[12](#R12)\u2013[17](#R17)]. Although the pharmacokinetic effects are clear, the clinical evidence linking genetic variants in other pharmacokinetic genes as well as statins other than simvastatin and atorvastatin with statin intolerance is sparse. Thus, we sought to study the effects of *SLCO1B1, ABCG2* and *CYP2C9* genotypes on statin intolerance in a large cohort of incident statin users linked to biobank and national register data.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and data sources\n\nThis was a register-based cohort study linking data from the Helsinki Biobank with Finnish national health registries to investigate pharmacogenomics of statins. Helsinki Biobank identified eligible individuals (see Study population). Information on drug purchases was collected from the drug reimbursement registry maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). The registry contains the identification code for drug purchased (ATC code), the date of purchase, the purchased amount in milligrams, the size of the package, and number of packages purchased covering all residents in Finland. In addition to first statin purchase, all subsequent statin purchases were collected from the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2016. Information about plasma creatine kinase (CK) measurements and date of measurements, was provided by Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory Services (HUSLAB). Helsinki Biobank linked information from these sources with pseudonymized identifiers assigned to every individual in the study. The biobank also provided pseudonymized DNA samples from all subjects for genotyping.\n\n### Study population\n\nThe study population consisted of patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. Individuals fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were included in the study: (1) at least one purchase of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin during the period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2016, (2) no purchase of a statin during 1997 and (3) a signed biobank consent and a DNA sample available in the Helsinki Biobank for analysis. Pitavastatin and lovastatin were not included because pitavastatin is not available in Finland and lovastatin usage is minimal. The first statin purchased by the study patient was defined as the index statin. Individuals were excluded from analysis based on the following criteria: (1) index statin was a simvastatin and ezetimibe combination product, (2) index statin was atorvastatin or rosuvastatin which was switched to another statin between May 2006 and April 2007 or (3) missing relevant genotype data. The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective. This led to excessive number of switches unrelated to statin intolerance from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to other statins between May 2006 and April 2007. One subject withdrew the biobank consent during the study and was excluded from the analyses. Follow-up started from the first purchase of the index statin and the study patients were censored from the analyses when they had no subsequent statin purchases during 365 days, they died, or the follow-up time ended (31 December 2016). Daily statin dose was assumed to be one unit per day [[18](#R18)].\n\n### Statin intolerance phenotypes\n\nPrimary statin intolerance phenotype was defined as a switch to another statin from the initially purchased index statin. Intolerance event date was defined as the last purchase date of the index statin before the switch. ATC code was used as an identifier for the drug used and thus change to another brand was not considered as a statin switch. Secondary intolerance phenotype was switch as defined in the primary intolerance phenotype combined with temporal relation to CK value measurement. Temporal relation was defined as CK measurement occurring within a period of 30 days before to 90 days after the intolerance event date. The CK measurement was considered as a binary outcome and the numeric value of the CK measurement was not considered in the analyses. Each intolerance phenotype was only analyzed if there were more than 10 occurrences of the phenotype for an index statin. Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) was used for defining the statin intolerance phenotypes.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nDNA samples were provided by the Helsinki Biobank at the concentration of 50 ng/\u00b5l. The participants were genotyped for the *ABCG2* rs2231142 (c.421C>A, p.Gln141Lys), *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 (c.521T>C, p.Val174Ala), and the *CYP2C9* rs1799853 (c.430C>T, p.Arg144Cys, **2*) and rs1057910 (c.1075A>G, p.Ile359Leu, **3*) single nucleotide variations (SNV) using TaqMan genotyping assays on OpenArray plates and the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Genotyping results were interpreted using TaqMan Genotyper Software v.1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for *CYP2C9*2* or **3* were classified as poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (PM), heterozygotes as intermediate metabolizers, and non-carriers as normal metabolizers.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nCox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate possible associations of genetic variants with the occurrence of the statin intolerance phenotypes. Daily statin doses were set as covariates in the analyses as categorical variables. Genotypes were analyzed as categorical variables using an additive model. In case the variant homozygous genotype group or the lowest or highest dose group contained less than 10 individuals, the group was joined with the adjacent group. The comparisons were carried out for individual SNVs, CYP2C9 metabolizer classes, or for the numbers of risk, that is, variant alleles in the candidate genes for a specific statin including the statin dose in the model. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium *P*-values were approximated with 10 000 permutations. The statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) and JMP Genomics 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).\n\n### Ethical aspects\n\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa approved the study (HUS/2926/2017). Permission to use the data and samples was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS/359/2017) and permissions to use the prescription data were obtained from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela 9/522/2018) and the clinical chemistry data from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL/161/5.05.00/2018). The research permit was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS 32/2018). After record linkage in the Helsinki Biobank, the data was provided to the study group in a pseudonymized form. The patients had given informed consent to Helsinki Biobank for their samples and data to be used for research purposes as defined in the Finnish Biobank Act.\n\n## Results\n\nData and DNA samples were obtained from 2242 biobank consented patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016 (Fig. [1](#F1)). A total of 200 patients were excluded from analysis due to one of the following reasons: withdrawal of biobank consent (n = 1), a fixed-dose simvastatin-ezetimibe combination as the index therapy (n = 2), unsuccessful genotyping of relevant variants (n = 68), or switch from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to another statin in the time between May 2006 and April 2007 (n = 129). The final study sample consisted of 2042 participants of whom 1073 (52.5%) were women. Their mean \u00b1 SD age was 60 \u00b1 11.8 years. Genotyping call rate ranged between 0.94 and 0.99 and the observed genotype frequencies were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table [1](#T1)). The observed minor allele frequencies were nearly identical to those observed in the Finnish population previously but differed slightly from previous data in the European population [[19](#R19),[20](#R20)].\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9549/10399933/9200564d7f77/pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10399933_pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\nData collection process, exclusions, and distribution of participants according to the statin initiated. *The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Gene | rsID | Nucleotide change | Amino acid change | Heterozygotes | Homozygotes | HWE, P-value | Call rate | MAF present study | MAF Finnisha | MAF Europeansb |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ABCG2 | rs2231142 | c.421C>A | p.Gln141Lys | 0.13 | 0.007 | 0.26 | 0.99 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.08 |\n| SLCO1B1 | rs4149056 | c.521T>C | p.Val174Ala | 0.32 | 0.043 | 0.65 | 0.97 | 0.20 | 0.21 | 0.16 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1799853 | c.430C>T | p.Arg144Cys | 0.19 | 0.016 | 0.08 | 0.94 | 0.11 | 0.11 | 0.12 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1057910 | c.1075A>G | p.Ile359Leu | 0.12 | 0.003 | 0.71 | 0.98 | 0.06 | 0.06 | 0.07 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Investigated single nucleotide variants and their frequencies among the 2241 Finnish patients\n\n### Simvastatin\n\nThe median follow-up time for simvastatin initiators was 532 days.

The effect was consistent in both of our intolerance phenotypes, the first based on statin switching only and the second based on statin switching and temporally associated CK measurement. By using these statin intolerance phenotypes, we also found a significant association of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with pravastatin intolerance.\n\nMajority of real-world evidence linking genetic factors with statin intolerance is based on either simvastatin users or at least a majority of simvastatin users due to historically widespread use of simvastatin in favor of other statins. Genetic association studies have rarely stratified for statin type in the primary analyses, in many cases due to insufficient sample size for statins other than simvastatin and in some cases atorvastatin [[11](#R11),[16](#R16)]. As the pharmacokinetics of statins differ from each other, we found it important, however, to stratify in the primary analyses by statin type in statin-na\u00efve statin initiators. Otherwise, possible associations could be diluted by differences in metabolic and disposition pathways of different statins. For example, common *SLCO1B1* and *ABCG2* variants differentially affect pharmacokinetics of specific statins [[6](#R6),[21](#R21)\u2013[28](#R28)]. Moreover, simvastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4/5, and fluvastatin is metabolized by the genetically polymorphic CYP2C9 [[9](#R9),[25](#R25),[28](#R28)\u2013[31](#R31)]. A tradeoff of this choice is that we could not account for multiple switches for individual subjects.\n\nDue to the epidemiological nature of our study, the definitions for statin intolerance were based on prescribing patterns (statin switching) or combination of prescribing patterns with clinical chemistry measurements (CK measurements) indicative of intolerance to statin therapy. Our definitions differed somewhat from similar previous studies based on electronic medical records without information about patient-reported symptoms for intolerance [[32](#R32),[33](#R33)]. We included only statin switching in our phenotype, since in our preliminary analyses with simvastatin-*SLCO1B1* statin switching rather than statin discontinuation or statin dose reduction, best-represented statin intolerance. This choice can be rationalized by the fact that statin discontinuation and dose reduction can occur for multitude of reasons not related to intolerance, which are not possible to be identified from the administrative registry data without access to electronic health records. Thus, statin switching is more likely to represent general statin intolerance but it can also be related to lack of efficacy. Consequently, we found it important to include an intolerance phenotype where change in statin prescribing was temporally associated with another indicator for intolerance, namely a CK measurement. Even though CK measurement can be ordered in various clinical situations, it is typically measured when statin-induced myopathy is suspected. Furthermore, muscle symptoms without CK elevation are a much more common form of statin-related myotoxicity than muscle symptoms with CK elevation [[1](#R1)]. Therefore, we included any CK measurement regardless of result to include also milder cases of myalgia not associated with CK increase. However, it should be noted that in the double-blinded STOMP trial, 9.4% of subjects treated with high dose atorvastatin experienced myalgia, whereas 4.6% of those treated with placebo experienced myalgia even after rechallenge [[34](#R34)]. Thus, our latter phenotype is more likely to represent muscle symptom-based statin intolerance, even though it might not be possible to separate between true statin-induced myalgia and symptoms unrelated to statins. The interval of 365 days between statin purchases for censoring was chosen to be able to catch statin switches after a pause of the initial statin. Our statin intolerance phenotype definitions were corroborated by robust associations of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with both intolerance phenotypes in simvastatin users.\n\nIn addition to simvastatin, we observed that heterozygous or homozygous *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C carriers had a higher risk of pravastatin intolerance based on statin switching phenotype when compared to reference allele homozygotes. It is noteworthy that the effect was observed in our cohort with low-moderate pravastatin doses as 40 mg is the highest approved dose of pravastatin in Europe rather than 80 mg available in the USA. In a previous pharmacogenetic study of statin efficacy and safety, 143 patients received 10 mg/day pravastatin for 8 weeks followed by 40 mg/day for 8 weeks [[16](#R16)]. Of these patients, 31 experienced a composite adverse event of either premature discontinuation due to any side effect, myalgia, or muscle cramps, or CK elevation during the 16-week follow-up. The *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV showed no association with the composite adverse event. The median follow-up time in our study was more than 2 years in pravastatin initiators, which may partly explain the differing results. Although most statin-induced muscle symptoms occur during the first months of statin usage, myotoxicity can occur even years after statin initiation [[7](#R7)].\n\nWe observed no statistically significant increase in statin intolerance risk for atorvastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin with the studied genotypes. For atorvastatin, no signals were evident for genotype-driven increased risk in our cohort of 780 atorvastatin users who most often had 10 and 20 mg prescribed as a starting dose. An earlier meta-analysis of 13 studies with a total of 1550 patients found that the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV associates with atorvastatin-induced adverse effects [[15](#R15)]. Moreover, in two recent prospective observational studies with substantial sample sizes (870 and 1627), the SNV was associated with an increased risk of atorvastatin intolerance or atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms [[17](#R17),[32](#R32)]. In the former study, 90% of the patients were using 80 mg/day atorvastatin, which is a substantially higher proportion than in our study and may partly explain the differing results. Nevertheless, the non-significant HR of 1.25 to 1.3 for the statin switch + CK measurement phenotype in C-allele carriers in our study is close to the odds ratio of 1.44 for atorvastatin intolerance and HR of 1.4 for atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms in the previous studies [[11](#R11)\u2013[13](#R13),[17](#R17),[35](#R35)].\n\nThe rosuvastatin cohort consisted of only 184 patients who had most often 5 or 10 mg prescribed starting dose with no tendencies for increased risk in carriers of the candidate risk alleles. The findings are in line with the JUPITER trial in which the *SLCO1B1* genotype was not associated with clinically reported myalgia in a clinical trial setting with rosuvastatin dose of 20 mg [[36](#R36)]. The median follow-up time for rosuvastatin was relatively short, due to a recent increase in its use. This may diminish the sensitivity to identify genotype-intolerance associations.\n\nFor fluvastatin, there was a trend towards increased risk of statin intolerance with a point estimate of HR at 1.88 in carriers of 2\u20134 risk alleles, but perhaps due to low sample size, the finding was not statistically significant. A previous study in renal transplant recipients with 52 cases of fluvastatin-induced adverse muscular or liver symptoms and 52 matched controls, showed that the *CYP2C9*2* and **3* alleles and the *ABCG2* c.421C>A SNV significantly increase the risk of these adverse reactions, with odds ratios between 2.4 and 6.6 [[37](#R37)]. Our data suggest that these alleles as well as the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV may increase the risk of fluvastatin intolerance also among general hypercholesterolemic patients, but further studies are required to confirm the findings.\n\nOur study has some limitations mainly related to its epidemiological and retrospective nature. Obviously, some prescribing changes occurring in our study are not related to statin intolerance and cases of true intolerance cannot be identified from the data. In any case, the study answers the clinical question of how the studied genotypes are related to statin switching. Furthermore, we eliminated obvious causes of confounding in prescribing patterns due to administrative factors by excluding time frames where atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were switched to other statins due to changes in reimbursement policies. The study population consisted of biobank-consented patients with available DNA samples who initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. As the Helsinki Biobank became operational in 2015, the majority of the study subjects had initiated their statin therapy before giving biobank consent and samples to the biobank, presenting a possibility for immortal time bias. For the current study design, this is not of major concern, however, as the study outcome was not related to survival. Moreover, the genotype frequencies observed were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and match those reported for the Finnish population (Table [1](#T1)). Lastly, due to low sample size in the fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin cohorts, care is warranted in making conclusions based on the current study alone.\n\nThe current study has several clinical implications. First, it corroborates the well-characterized association of *SLCO1B1* genotype with simvastatin intolerance in a real-world setting. Second, despite limited numbers, the *SLCO1B1* genotype associated with pravastatin intolerance at a dose range of 20\u201340 mg, supporting the role of OATP1B1 activity in pravastatin adverse effects. Third, even though no statistically significant genotype associations were observed for atorvastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin, these results can be used in future meta-analyses and in compilation of clinically actionable pharmacogenetic guidelines.\n\nIn conclusion, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C genotype was associated with increased switching of simvastatin and pravastatin to other statins in an epidemiological biobank study. The intolerance phenotype derived from statin switching alone or combined with CK measurement appears to be suitable to evaluate statin intolerance. Further studies in larger populations are required to examine the pharmacogenetics of statin intolerance.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all study participants for their participation in the biobank research and the Helsinki Biobank for establishing the study cohort.\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the European Research Council (Grant agreement 725249), State funding for university-level health research, and the Sigrid Jus\u00e9lius Foundation (Helsinki, Finland).\n\n### Conflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n1.

They are used both in primary and secondary prevention to reduce cardiovascular risk. Even though statins are generally well tolerated, their most typical adverse effects include muscular toxicity ranging from relatively common muscle pain (myalgia) to very rare but potentially life-threatening rhabdomyolysis [[1](#R1)]. Statin-induced muscle toxicity is a dose- and concentration-dependent phenomenon [[2](#R2),[3](#R3)], and several predisposing factors due to increased statin concentrations have been identified, including drug-drug interactions and genetic factors [[4](#R4)\u2013[7](#R7)].\n\nStatins are similar in their pharmacodynamic effects, but their pharmacokinetic properties exhibit significant differences [[8](#R8),[9](#R9)]. Simvastatin and lovastatin are administered as inactive lactones and are converted to an active acid form, whereas other statins in clinical use (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) are administered in the active acid form. The main clearance mechanism for the more lipophilic statins is oxidative biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) and CYP2C9 (fluvastatin), whereas the more hydrophilic statins (pitavastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin) are excreted mainly unchanged. Furthermore, all statins are transported by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (encoded by *SLCO1B1*) and atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, encoded by *ABCG2*) [[5](#R5),[8](#R8),[10](#R10)]. Accordingly, genetic variability affecting the function of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can have a profound impact on statin pharmacokinetics, translating into altered risk for concentration-dependent adverse effects between individuals at equal doses.\n\nA recently published Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline on the pharmacogenetics of statin-induced muscle symptoms provided therapeutic recommendations for statins based on *SLCO1B1, ABCG2*, and *CYP2C9* genotypes [[11](#R11)]. Simvastatin acid is among the most sensitive drugs to alterations in *SLCO1B1* genotype [[5](#R5),[6](#R6),[12](#R12)\u2013[14](#R14)]. Moreover, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C has been consistently associated with simvastatin and atorvastatin-induced myopathy and intolerance, especially when high doses are used [[5](#R5),[7](#R7),[12](#R12)\u2013[17](#R17)]. Although the pharmacokinetic effects are clear, the clinical evidence linking genetic variants in other pharmacokinetic genes as well as statins other than simvastatin and atorvastatin with statin intolerance is sparse. Thus, we sought to study the effects of *SLCO1B1, ABCG2* and *CYP2C9* genotypes on statin intolerance in a large cohort of incident statin users linked to biobank and national register data.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and data sources\n\nThis was a register-based cohort study linking data from the Helsinki Biobank with Finnish national health registries to investigate pharmacogenomics of statins. Helsinki Biobank identified eligible individuals (see Study population). Information on drug purchases was collected from the drug reimbursement registry maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). The registry contains the identification code for drug purchased (ATC code), the date of purchase, the purchased amount in milligrams, the size of the package, and number of packages purchased covering all residents in Finland. In addition to first statin purchase, all subsequent statin purchases were collected from the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2016. Information about plasma creatine kinase (CK) measurements and date of measurements, was provided by Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory Services (HUSLAB). Helsinki Biobank linked information from these sources with pseudonymized identifiers assigned to every individual in the study. The biobank also provided pseudonymized DNA samples from all subjects for genotyping.\n\n### Study population\n\nThe study population consisted of patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. Individuals fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were included in the study: (1) at least one purchase of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin during the period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2016, (2) no purchase of a statin during 1997 and (3) a signed biobank consent and a DNA sample available in the Helsinki Biobank for analysis. Pitavastatin and lovastatin were not included because pitavastatin is not available in Finland and lovastatin usage is minimal. The first statin purchased by the study patient was defined as the index statin. Individuals were excluded from analysis based on the following criteria: (1) index statin was a simvastatin and ezetimibe combination product, (2) index statin was atorvastatin or rosuvastatin which was switched to another statin between May 2006 and April 2007 or (3) missing relevant genotype data. The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective. This led to excessive number of switches unrelated to statin intolerance from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to other statins between May 2006 and April 2007. One subject withdrew the biobank consent during the study and was excluded from the analyses. Follow-up started from the first purchase of the index statin and the study patients were censored from the analyses when they had no subsequent statin purchases during 365 days, they died, or the follow-up time ended (31 December 2016). Daily statin dose was assumed to be one unit per day [[18](#R18)].\n\n### Statin intolerance phenotypes\n\nPrimary statin intolerance phenotype was defined as a switch to another statin from the initially purchased index statin. Intolerance event date was defined as the last purchase date of the index statin before the switch. ATC code was used as an identifier for the drug used and thus change to another brand was not considered as a statin switch. Secondary intolerance phenotype was switch as defined in the primary intolerance phenotype combined with temporal relation to CK value measurement. Temporal relation was defined as CK measurement occurring within a period of 30 days before to 90 days after the intolerance event date. The CK measurement was considered as a binary outcome and the numeric value of the CK measurement was not considered in the analyses. Each intolerance phenotype was only analyzed if there were more than 10 occurrences of the phenotype for an index statin. Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) was used for defining the statin intolerance phenotypes.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nDNA samples were provided by the Helsinki Biobank at the concentration of 50 ng/\u00b5l. The participants were genotyped for the *ABCG2* rs2231142 (c.421C>A, p.Gln141Lys), *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 (c.521T>C, p.Val174Ala), and the *CYP2C9* rs1799853 (c.430C>T, p.Arg144Cys, **2*) and rs1057910 (c.1075A>G, p.Ile359Leu, **3*) single nucleotide variations (SNV) using TaqMan genotyping assays on OpenArray plates and the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Genotyping results were interpreted using TaqMan Genotyper Software v.1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for *CYP2C9*2* or **3* were classified as poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (PM), heterozygotes as intermediate metabolizers, and non-carriers as normal metabolizers.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nCox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate possible associations of genetic variants with the occurrence of the statin intolerance phenotypes. Daily statin doses were set as covariates in the analyses as categorical variables. Genotypes were analyzed as categorical variables using an additive model. In case the variant homozygous genotype group or the lowest or highest dose group contained less than 10 individuals, the group was joined with the adjacent group. The comparisons were carried out for individual SNVs, CYP2C9 metabolizer classes, or for the numbers of risk, that is, variant alleles in the candidate genes for a specific statin including the statin dose in the model. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium *P*-values were approximated with 10 000 permutations. The statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) and JMP Genomics 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).\n\n### Ethical aspects\n\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa approved the study (HUS/2926/2017). Permission to use the data and samples was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS/359/2017) and permissions to use the prescription data were obtained from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela 9/522/2018) and the clinical chemistry data from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL/161/5.05.00/2018). The research permit was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS 32/2018). After record linkage in the Helsinki Biobank, the data was provided to the study group in a pseudonymized form. The patients had given informed consent to Helsinki Biobank for their samples and data to be used for research purposes as defined in the Finnish Biobank Act.\n\n## Results\n\nData and DNA samples were obtained from 2242 biobank consented patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016 (Fig. [1](#F1)). A total of 200 patients were excluded from analysis due to one of the following reasons: withdrawal of biobank consent (n = 1), a fixed-dose simvastatin-ezetimibe combination as the index therapy (n = 2), unsuccessful genotyping of relevant variants (n = 68), or switch from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to another statin in the time between May 2006 and April 2007 (n = 129). The final study sample consisted of 2042 participants of whom 1073 (52.5%) were women. Their mean \u00b1 SD age was 60 \u00b1 11.8 years. Genotyping call rate ranged between 0.94 and 0.99 and the observed genotype frequencies were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table [1](#T1)). The observed minor allele frequencies were nearly identical to those observed in the Finnish population previously but differed slightly from previous data in the European population [[19](#R19),[20](#R20)].\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9549/10399933/9200564d7f77/pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10399933_pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\nData collection process, exclusions, and distribution of participants according to the statin initiated. *The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Gene | rsID | Nucleotide change | Amino acid change | Heterozygotes | Homozygotes | HWE, P-value | Call rate | MAF present study | MAF Finnisha | MAF Europeansb |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ABCG2 | rs2231142 | c.421C>A | p.Gln141Lys | 0.13 | 0.007 | 0.26 | 0.99 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.08 |\n| SLCO1B1 | rs4149056 | c.521T>C | p.Val174Ala | 0.32 | 0.043 | 0.65 | 0.97 | 0.20 | 0.21 | 0.16 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1799853 | c.430C>T | p.Arg144Cys | 0.19 | 0.016 | 0.08 | 0.94 | 0.11 | 0.11 | 0.12 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1057910 | c.1075A>G | p.Ile359Leu | 0.12 | 0.003 | 0.71 | 0.98 | 0.06 | 0.06 | 0.07 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Investigated single nucleotide variants and their frequencies among the 2241 Finnish patients\n\n### Simvastatin\n\nThe median follow-up time for simvastatin initiators was 532 days.

The effect was consistent in both of our intolerance phenotypes, the first based on statin switching only and the second based on statin switching and temporally associated CK measurement. By using these statin intolerance phenotypes, we also found a significant association of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with pravastatin intolerance.\n\nMajority of real-world evidence linking genetic factors with statin intolerance is based on either simvastatin users or at least a majority of simvastatin users due to historically widespread use of simvastatin in favor of other statins. Genetic association studies have rarely stratified for statin type in the primary analyses, in many cases due to insufficient sample size for statins other than simvastatin and in some cases atorvastatin [[11](#R11),[16](#R16)]. As the pharmacokinetics of statins differ from each other, we found it important, however, to stratify in the primary analyses by statin type in statin-na\u00efve statin initiators. Otherwise, possible associations could be diluted by differences in metabolic and disposition pathways of different statins. For example, common *SLCO1B1* and *ABCG2* variants differentially affect pharmacokinetics of specific statins [[6](#R6),[21](#R21)\u2013[28](#R28)]. Moreover, simvastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4/5, and fluvastatin is metabolized by the genetically polymorphic CYP2C9 [[9](#R9),[25](#R25),[28](#R28)\u2013[31](#R31)]. A tradeoff of this choice is that we could not account for multiple switches for individual subjects.\n\nDue to the epidemiological nature of our study, the definitions for statin intolerance were based on prescribing patterns (statin switching) or combination of prescribing patterns with clinical chemistry measurements (CK measurements) indicative of intolerance to statin therapy. Our definitions differed somewhat from similar previous studies based on electronic medical records without information about patient-reported symptoms for intolerance [[32](#R32),[33](#R33)]. We included only statin switching in our phenotype, since in our preliminary analyses with simvastatin-*SLCO1B1* statin switching rather than statin discontinuation or statin dose reduction, best-represented statin intolerance. This choice can be rationalized by the fact that statin discontinuation and dose reduction can occur for multitude of reasons not related to intolerance, which are not possible to be identified from the administrative registry data without access to electronic health records. Thus, statin switching is more likely to represent general statin intolerance but it can also be related to lack of efficacy. Consequently, we found it important to include an intolerance phenotype where change in statin prescribing was temporally associated with another indicator for intolerance, namely a CK measurement. Even though CK measurement can be ordered in various clinical situations, it is typically measured when statin-induced myopathy is suspected. Furthermore, muscle symptoms without CK elevation are a much more common form of statin-related myotoxicity than muscle symptoms with CK elevation [[1](#R1)]. Therefore, we included any CK measurement regardless of result to include also milder cases of myalgia not associated with CK increase. However, it should be noted that in the double-blinded STOMP trial, 9.4% of subjects treated with high dose atorvastatin experienced myalgia, whereas 4.6% of those treated with placebo experienced myalgia even after rechallenge [[34](#R34)]. Thus, our latter phenotype is more likely to represent muscle symptom-based statin intolerance, even though it might not be possible to separate between true statin-induced myalgia and symptoms unrelated to statins. The interval of 365 days between statin purchases for censoring was chosen to be able to catch statin switches after a pause of the initial statin. Our statin intolerance phenotype definitions were corroborated by robust associations of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with both intolerance phenotypes in simvastatin users.\n\nIn addition to simvastatin, we observed that heterozygous or homozygous *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C carriers had a higher risk of pravastatin intolerance based on statin switching phenotype when compared to reference allele homozygotes. It is noteworthy that the effect was observed in our cohort with low-moderate pravastatin doses as 40 mg is the highest approved dose of pravastatin in Europe rather than 80 mg available in the USA. In a previous pharmacogenetic study of statin efficacy and safety, 143 patients received 10 mg/day pravastatin for 8 weeks followed by 40 mg/day for 8 weeks [[16](#R16)]. Of these patients, 31 experienced a composite adverse event of either premature discontinuation due to any side effect, myalgia, or muscle cramps, or CK elevation during the 16-week follow-up. The *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV showed no association with the composite adverse event. The median follow-up time in our study was more than 2 years in pravastatin initiators, which may partly explain the differing results. Although most statin-induced muscle symptoms occur during the first months of statin usage, myotoxicity can occur even years after statin initiation [[7](#R7)].\n\nWe observed no statistically significant increase in statin intolerance risk for atorvastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin with the studied genotypes. For atorvastatin, no signals were evident for genotype-driven increased risk in our cohort of 780 atorvastatin users who most often had 10 and 20 mg prescribed as a starting dose. An earlier meta-analysis of 13 studies with a total of 1550 patients found that the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV associates with atorvastatin-induced adverse effects [[15](#R15)]. Moreover, in two recent prospective observational studies with substantial sample sizes (870 and 1627), the SNV was associated with an increased risk of atorvastatin intolerance or atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms [[17](#R17),[32](#R32)]. In the former study, 90% of the patients were using 80 mg/day atorvastatin, which is a substantially higher proportion than in our study and may partly explain the differing results. Nevertheless, the non-significant HR of 1.25 to 1.3 for the statin switch + CK measurement phenotype in C-allele carriers in our study is close to the odds ratio of 1.44 for atorvastatin intolerance and HR of 1.4 for atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms in the previous studies [[11](#R11)\u2013[13](#R13),[17](#R17),[35](#R35)].\n\nThe rosuvastatin cohort consisted of only 184 patients who had most often 5 or 10 mg prescribed starting dose with no tendencies for increased risk in carriers of the candidate risk alleles. The findings are in line with the JUPITER trial in which the *SLCO1B1* genotype was not associated with clinically reported myalgia in a clinical trial setting with rosuvastatin dose of 20 mg [[36](#R36)]. The median follow-up time for rosuvastatin was relatively short, due to a recent increase in its use. This may diminish the sensitivity to identify genotype-intolerance associations.\n\nFor fluvastatin, there was a trend towards increased risk of statin intolerance with a point estimate of HR at 1.88 in carriers of 2\u20134 risk alleles, but perhaps due to low sample size, the finding was not statistically significant. A previous study in renal transplant recipients with 52 cases of fluvastatin-induced adverse muscular or liver symptoms and 52 matched controls, showed that the *CYP2C9*2* and **3* alleles and the *ABCG2* c.421C>A SNV significantly increase the risk of these adverse reactions, with odds ratios between 2.4 and 6.6 [[37](#R37)]. Our data suggest that these alleles as well as the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV may increase the risk of fluvastatin intolerance also among general hypercholesterolemic patients, but further studies are required to confirm the findings.\n\nOur study has some limitations mainly related to its epidemiological and retrospective nature. Obviously, some prescribing changes occurring in our study are not related to statin intolerance and cases of true intolerance cannot be identified from the data. In any case, the study answers the clinical question of how the studied genotypes are related to statin switching. Furthermore, we eliminated obvious causes of confounding in prescribing patterns due to administrative factors by excluding time frames where atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were switched to other statins due to changes in reimbursement policies. The study population consisted of biobank-consented patients with available DNA samples who initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. As the Helsinki Biobank became operational in 2015, the majority of the study subjects had initiated their statin therapy before giving biobank consent and samples to the biobank, presenting a possibility for immortal time bias. For the current study design, this is not of major concern, however, as the study outcome was not related to survival. Moreover, the genotype frequencies observed were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and match those reported for the Finnish population (Table [1](#T1)). Lastly, due to low sample size in the fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin cohorts, care is warranted in making conclusions based on the current study alone.\n\nThe current study has several clinical implications. First, it corroborates the well-characterized association of *SLCO1B1* genotype with simvastatin intolerance in a real-world setting. Second, despite limited numbers, the *SLCO1B1* genotype associated with pravastatin intolerance at a dose range of 20\u201340 mg, supporting the role of OATP1B1 activity in pravastatin adverse effects. Third, even though no statistically significant genotype associations were observed for atorvastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin, these results can be used in future meta-analyses and in compilation of clinically actionable pharmacogenetic guidelines.\n\nIn conclusion, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C genotype was associated with increased switching of simvastatin and pravastatin to other statins in an epidemiological biobank study. The intolerance phenotype derived from statin switching alone or combined with CK measurement appears to be suitable to evaluate statin intolerance. Further studies in larger populations are required to examine the pharmacogenetics of statin intolerance.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all study participants for their participation in the biobank research and the Helsinki Biobank for establishing the study cohort.\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the European Research Council (Grant agreement 725249), State funding for university-level health research, and the Sigrid Jus\u00e9lius Foundation (Helsinki, Finland).\n\n### Conflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n1.

Drug names (e.g., \"Statin switch, simvastatin\", \"Statin switch, atorvastatin\")\n  - Disease conditions\n  - Age groups (e.g., \"Age > 65 years\")\n  - Gender specifications (e.g., \"Male patients\", \"Female patients\")\n  - Dose information if relevant to the cohort\n- Be specific and include all distinguishing details\n\n### Characteristics Type\n- Standardized category for the Characteristics field\n- Valid values: \"disease\", \"drug\", \"age group\", \"gender\", \"study cohort\", \"Study Cohort\"\n- Most pharmacogenetics studies use \"Study Cohort\" or \"drug\"\n\n### Frequency In Cases / Frequency In Controls\n- Extract allele frequencies if explicitly reported\n- Format: decimal number (e.g., 0.21, 0.043)\n- Look for phrases like: \"allele frequency was 0.21\", \"MAF = 0.15\"\n\n### Allele Of Frequency In Cases / Allele Of Frequency In Controls\n- The specific allele the frequency refers to\n- Format: single letter or variant notation (e.g., \"C\", \"T\", \"A\")\n\n### P Value\n- **Critical field**: Extract the p-value with its operator\n- Format: \"= 0.025\", \"< 0.001\", \"> 0.05\"\n- ALWAYS include the operator (=, <, >)\n- Look for: \"P = 0.025\", \"*P* = 0.011\", \"p-value = 0.047\"\n\n### Ratio Stat Type\n- Type of statistical ratio reported\n- Valid values: \"OR\" (odds ratio), \"RR\" (relative risk), \"HR\" (hazard ratio), \"Unknown\"\n- Look for: \"HR\", \"odds ratio\", \"relative risk\"\n- Use \"Unknown\" if a p-value is reported but no ratio type is specified\n\n### Ratio Stat\n- The numerical value of the ratio\n- Extract the point estimate: \"HR 1.88\" \u2192 1.88\n- Must be a number\n\n### Confidence Interval Start / Stop\n- Extract the confidence interval bounds\n- From \"95% CI 1.08\u20133.25\": Start = 1.08, Stop = 3.25\n- Watch for various notations: \"1.08-3.25\", \"1.08 to 3.25\", \"(1.08, 3.25)\"\n\n### Biogeographical Groups\n- Population ancestry/ethnicity of study participants\n- Valid values: \"African America/Afro-Caribbean\", \"American\", \"Central/South Asian\", \"East Asian\", \"European\", \"Latino\", \"Near Eastern\", \"Oceanian\", \"Sub-Saharan African\", \"Unknown\", \"Multiple Groups\"\n- \"Multiple Groups\" = study included participants from multiple populations\n- Look in Methods section for population description\n\n### Variant Annotation ID_norm\n- Leave as `null` (will be assigned later)\n\n## Extraction Strategy\n\n1. **Identify all statistical comparisons**: Look for hazard ratios, odds ratios, p-values, and confidence intervals in Results section\n\n2. **Create separate entries for each cohort/comparison**: If the study analyzes multiple drugs, genotypes, or subgroups, create a separate study parameter entry for each\n\n3. **Match statistics to cohorts**: Ensure each HR/OR/p-value is correctly associated with the right patient group or drug\n\n4. **Extract from Tables**: Statistical results are often in tables - extract each row as a separate entry\n\n5. **Handle multiple phenotypes**: If the study uses different outcome definitions (e.g., \"statin switch\" vs \"statin switch + CK measurement\"), create separate entries for each\n\n## Example Extraction\n\n**From the text:**\n\"We confirmed the association of SLCO1B1 c.521C/C genotype with simvastatin intolerance both by using phenotype of switching initial statin to another as a marker of statin intolerance [hazard ratio (HR) 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08\u20133.25, P = 0.025] and statin switching along with creatine kinase measurement (HR 5.44, 95% CI 1.49\u201319.9, P = 0.011).\"\n\n**Study context:**\n- 916 simvastatin users (European population)\n- Cohort study design\n\n**Extract as TWO entries:**\n\nEntry 1:\n```json\n{\n  \"Study Parameters ID\": null,\n  \"Variant Annotation ID\": null,\n  \"Study Type\": null,\n  \"Study Cases\": 916.0,\n  \"Study Controls\": null,\n  \"Characteristics\": \"Statin switch\",\n  \"Characteristics Type\": \"Study Cohort\",\n  \"Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"P Value\": \"= 0.025\",\n  \"Ratio Stat Type\": \"HR\",\n  \"Ratio Stat\": 1.88,\n  \"Confidence Interval Start\": 1.08,\n  \"Confidence Interval Stop\": 3.25,\n  \"Biogeographical Groups\": \"European\",\n  \"Variant Annotation ID_norm\": null\n}\n```\n\nEntry 2:\n```json\n{\n  \"Study Parameters ID\": null,\n  \"Variant Annotation ID\": null,\n  \"Study Type\": null,\n  \"Study Cases\": 916.0,\n  \"Study Controls\": null,\n  \"Characteristics\": \"Statin switch\",\n  \"Characteristics Type\": \"Study Cohort\",\n  \"Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Cases\": null,\n  \"Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"Allele Of Frequency In Controls\": null,\n  \"P Value\": \"= 0.011\",\n  \"Ratio Stat Type\": \"HR\",\n  \"Ratio Stat\": 5.44,\n  \"Confidence Interval Start\": 1.49,\n  \"Confidence Interval Stop\": 19.9,\n  \"Biogeographical Groups\": \"European\",\n  \"Variant Annotation ID_norm\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore submitting your extraction:\n- [ ] Each statistical result has its own entry\n- [ ] P Values include operators (=, <, >)\n- [ ] Confidence intervals are paired correctly (start < stop)\n- [ ] Study Cases numbers are extracted for each cohort\n- [ ] Characteristics describe what makes each cohort unique\n- [ ] All null values are explicitly set to `null`, not empty strings\n- [ ] Biogeographical Groups use exact terminology from the valid values list\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't merge multiple comparisons** - Each HR/OR/RR with its p-value should be a separate entry\n2. **Don't forget the operator in P Values** - Always include =, <, or >\n3. **Don't confuse cohort size** - For sub-analyses (e.g., \"780 atorvastatin users\"), use 780, not the total study N\n4. **Don't use empty strings for missing data** -

They are used both in primary and secondary prevention to reduce cardiovascular risk. Even though statins are generally well tolerated, their most typical adverse effects include muscular toxicity ranging from relatively common muscle pain (myalgia) to very rare but potentially life-threatening rhabdomyolysis [[1](#R1)]. Statin-induced muscle toxicity is a dose- and concentration-dependent phenomenon [[2](#R2),[3](#R3)], and several predisposing factors due to increased statin concentrations have been identified, including drug-drug interactions and genetic factors [[4](#R4)\u2013[7](#R7)].\n\nStatins are similar in their pharmacodynamic effects, but their pharmacokinetic properties exhibit significant differences [[8](#R8),[9](#R9)]. Simvastatin and lovastatin are administered as inactive lactones and are converted to an active acid form, whereas other statins in clinical use (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) are administered in the active acid form. The main clearance mechanism for the more lipophilic statins is oxidative biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) and CYP2C9 (fluvastatin), whereas the more hydrophilic statins (pitavastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin) are excreted mainly unchanged. Furthermore, all statins are transported by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (encoded by *SLCO1B1*) and atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, encoded by *ABCG2*) [[5](#R5),[8](#R8),[10](#R10)]. Accordingly, genetic variability affecting the function of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can have a profound impact on statin pharmacokinetics, translating into altered risk for concentration-dependent adverse effects between individuals at equal doses.\n\nA recently published Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline on the pharmacogenetics of statin-induced muscle symptoms provided therapeutic recommendations for statins based on *SLCO1B1, ABCG2*, and *CYP2C9* genotypes [[11](#R11)]. Simvastatin acid is among the most sensitive drugs to alterations in *SLCO1B1* genotype [[5](#R5),[6](#R6),[12](#R12)\u2013[14](#R14)]. Moreover, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C has been consistently associated with simvastatin and atorvastatin-induced myopathy and intolerance, especially when high doses are used [[5](#R5),[7](#R7),[12](#R12)\u2013[17](#R17)]. Although the pharmacokinetic effects are clear, the clinical evidence linking genetic variants in other pharmacokinetic genes as well as statins other than simvastatin and atorvastatin with statin intolerance is sparse. Thus, we sought to study the effects of *SLCO1B1, ABCG2* and *CYP2C9* genotypes on statin intolerance in a large cohort of incident statin users linked to biobank and national register data.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and data sources\n\nThis was a register-based cohort study linking data from the Helsinki Biobank with Finnish national health registries to investigate pharmacogenomics of statins. Helsinki Biobank identified eligible individuals (see Study population). Information on drug purchases was collected from the drug reimbursement registry maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). The registry contains the identification code for drug purchased (ATC code), the date of purchase, the purchased amount in milligrams, the size of the package, and number of packages purchased covering all residents in Finland. In addition to first statin purchase, all subsequent statin purchases were collected from the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2016. Information about plasma creatine kinase (CK) measurements and date of measurements, was provided by Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory Services (HUSLAB). Helsinki Biobank linked information from these sources with pseudonymized identifiers assigned to every individual in the study. The biobank also provided pseudonymized DNA samples from all subjects for genotyping.\n\n### Study population\n\nThe study population consisted of patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. Individuals fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were included in the study: (1) at least one purchase of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin during the period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2016, (2) no purchase of a statin during 1997 and (3) a signed biobank consent and a DNA sample available in the Helsinki Biobank for analysis. Pitavastatin and lovastatin were not included because pitavastatin is not available in Finland and lovastatin usage is minimal. The first statin purchased by the study patient was defined as the index statin. Individuals were excluded from analysis based on the following criteria: (1) index statin was a simvastatin and ezetimibe combination product, (2) index statin was atorvastatin or rosuvastatin which was switched to another statin between May 2006 and April 2007 or (3) missing relevant genotype data. The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective. This led to excessive number of switches unrelated to statin intolerance from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to other statins between May 2006 and April 2007. One subject withdrew the biobank consent during the study and was excluded from the analyses. Follow-up started from the first purchase of the index statin and the study patients were censored from the analyses when they had no subsequent statin purchases during 365 days, they died, or the follow-up time ended (31 December 2016). Daily statin dose was assumed to be one unit per day [[18](#R18)].\n\n### Statin intolerance phenotypes\n\nPrimary statin intolerance phenotype was defined as a switch to another statin from the initially purchased index statin. Intolerance event date was defined as the last purchase date of the index statin before the switch. ATC code was used as an identifier for the drug used and thus change to another brand was not considered as a statin switch. Secondary intolerance phenotype was switch as defined in the primary intolerance phenotype combined with temporal relation to CK value measurement. Temporal relation was defined as CK measurement occurring within a period of 30 days before to 90 days after the intolerance event date. The CK measurement was considered as a binary outcome and the numeric value of the CK measurement was not considered in the analyses. Each intolerance phenotype was only analyzed if there were more than 10 occurrences of the phenotype for an index statin. Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) was used for defining the statin intolerance phenotypes.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nDNA samples were provided by the Helsinki Biobank at the concentration of 50 ng/\u00b5l. The participants were genotyped for the *ABCG2* rs2231142 (c.421C>A, p.Gln141Lys), *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 (c.521T>C, p.Val174Ala), and the *CYP2C9* rs1799853 (c.430C>T, p.Arg144Cys, **2*) and rs1057910 (c.1075A>G, p.Ile359Leu, **3*) single nucleotide variations (SNV) using TaqMan genotyping assays on OpenArray plates and the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Genotyping results were interpreted using TaqMan Genotyper Software v.1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for *CYP2C9*2* or **3* were classified as poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (PM), heterozygotes as intermediate metabolizers, and non-carriers as normal metabolizers.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nCox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate possible associations of genetic variants with the occurrence of the statin intolerance phenotypes. Daily statin doses were set as covariates in the analyses as categorical variables. Genotypes were analyzed as categorical variables using an additive model. In case the variant homozygous genotype group or the lowest or highest dose group contained less than 10 individuals, the group was joined with the adjacent group. The comparisons were carried out for individual SNVs, CYP2C9 metabolizer classes, or for the numbers of risk, that is, variant alleles in the candidate genes for a specific statin including the statin dose in the model. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium *P*-values were approximated with 10 000 permutations. The statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) and JMP Genomics 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).\n\n### Ethical aspects\n\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa approved the study (HUS/2926/2017). Permission to use the data and samples was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS/359/2017) and permissions to use the prescription data were obtained from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela 9/522/2018) and the clinical chemistry data from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL/161/5.05.00/2018). The research permit was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS 32/2018). After record linkage in the Helsinki Biobank, the data was provided to the study group in a pseudonymized form. The patients had given informed consent to Helsinki Biobank for their samples and data to be used for research purposes as defined in the Finnish Biobank Act.\n\n## Results\n\nData and DNA samples were obtained from 2242 biobank consented patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016 (Fig. [1](#F1)). A total of 200 patients were excluded from analysis due to one of the following reasons: withdrawal of biobank consent (n = 1), a fixed-dose simvastatin-ezetimibe combination as the index therapy (n = 2), unsuccessful genotyping of relevant variants (n = 68), or switch from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to another statin in the time between May 2006 and April 2007 (n = 129). The final study sample consisted of 2042 participants of whom 1073 (52.5%) were women. Their mean \u00b1 SD age was 60 \u00b1 11.8 years. Genotyping call rate ranged between 0.94 and 0.99 and the observed genotype frequencies were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table [1](#T1)). The observed minor allele frequencies were nearly identical to those observed in the Finnish population previously but differed slightly from previous data in the European population [[19](#R19),[20](#R20)].\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9549/10399933/9200564d7f77/pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10399933_pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\nData collection process, exclusions, and distribution of participants according to the statin initiated. *The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Gene | rsID | Nucleotide change | Amino acid change | Heterozygotes | Homozygotes | HWE, P-value | Call rate | MAF present study | MAF Finnisha | MAF Europeansb |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ABCG2 | rs2231142 | c.421C>A | p.Gln141Lys | 0.13 | 0.007 | 0.26 | 0.99 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.08 |\n| SLCO1B1 | rs4149056 | c.521T>C | p.Val174Ala | 0.32 | 0.043 | 0.65 | 0.97 | 0.20 | 0.21 | 0.16 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1799853 | c.430C>T | p.Arg144Cys | 0.19 | 0.016 | 0.08 | 0.94 | 0.11 | 0.11 | 0.12 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1057910 | c.1075A>G | p.Ile359Leu | 0.12 | 0.003 | 0.71 | 0.98 | 0.06 | 0.06 | 0.07 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Investigated single nucleotide variants and their frequencies among the 2241 Finnish patients\n\n### Simvastatin\n\nThe median follow-up time for simvastatin initiators was 532 days. Of the total 916 simvastatin users, 232 were classified as statin switchers and of those, 22 had a temporally qualifying CK measurement (statin switchers with CK measurement; Fig. [1](#F1)). In the Cox proportional hazards model accounting for the statin dose, *SLCO1B1* c.521C/C genotype was associated with an increased risk of simvastatin intolerance when compared to homozygous reference T/T genotype using both statin switcher [hazard ratio (HR) 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08\u20133.25, *P* = 0.025] and statin switcher with CK measurement (HR 5.44, 95% CI 1.49\u201319.9, *P* = 0.011) phenotypes (Table [2](#T2)). Simvastatin dose of 40 mg or higher was also associated with the statin switcher phenotype when compared to 10 mg dose (HR 1.48, 95% 1.03\u20132.12, *P *= 0.035).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Variable | n | Statin switch |  |  | Statin switch + CK measurement |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Events (n) | Hazard ratio (95% CI) | P-value | Events (n) | Hazard ratio (95% CI) | P-value |  |  |\n| SLCO1B1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 10 mg dose | 229 | 46 |   |   | 3 |   |   |\n| 20 mg dose | 451 | 103 | 1.13 (0.80\u20131.60) | 0.498 | 12 | 2.00 (0.56\u20137.14) | 0.284 |\n| 40 mg or 80 mg dose | 236 | 83 | 1.48 (1.03\u20132.12) | 0.035 | 7 | 1.84 (0.47\u20137.12) | 0.379 |\n| c.521T/T | 584 | 146 |   |   | 10 |   |   |\n| c.521T/C | 300 | 72 | 0.94 (0.70\u20131.24) | 0.640 | 9 | 1.75 (0.71\u20134.31) | 0.226 |\n| c.521C/C | 32 | 14 | 1.88 (1.08\u20133.25) | 0.025 | 3 | 5.44 (1.49\u201319.9) | 0.011 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Associations of SLCO1B1 c.521T>C single nucleotide variation with intolerance to simvastatin\n\n### Atorvastatin\n\nAtorvastatin had median follow-up time of 556.5 days.

The effect was consistent in both of our intolerance phenotypes, the first based on statin switching only and the second based on statin switching and temporally associated CK measurement. By using these statin intolerance phenotypes, we also found a significant association of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with pravastatin intolerance.\n\nMajority of real-world evidence linking genetic factors with statin intolerance is based on either simvastatin users or at least a majority of simvastatin users due to historically widespread use of simvastatin in favor of other statins. Genetic association studies have rarely stratified for statin type in the primary analyses, in many cases due to insufficient sample size for statins other than simvastatin and in some cases atorvastatin [[11](#R11),[16](#R16)]. As the pharmacokinetics of statins differ from each other, we found it important, however, to stratify in the primary analyses by statin type in statin-na\u00efve statin initiators. Otherwise, possible associations could be diluted by differences in metabolic and disposition pathways of different statins. For example, common *SLCO1B1* and *ABCG2* variants differentially affect pharmacokinetics of specific statins [[6](#R6),[21](#R21)\u2013[28](#R28)]. Moreover, simvastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4/5, and fluvastatin is metabolized by the genetically polymorphic CYP2C9 [[9](#R9),[25](#R25),[28](#R28)\u2013[31](#R31)]. A tradeoff of this choice is that we could not account for multiple switches for individual subjects.\n\nDue to the epidemiological nature of our study, the definitions for statin intolerance were based on prescribing patterns (statin switching) or combination of prescribing patterns with clinical chemistry measurements (CK measurements) indicative of intolerance to statin therapy. Our definitions differed somewhat from similar previous studies based on electronic medical records without information about patient-reported symptoms for intolerance [[32](#R32),[33](#R33)]. We included only statin switching in our phenotype, since in our preliminary analyses with simvastatin-*SLCO1B1* statin switching rather than statin discontinuation or statin dose reduction, best-represented statin intolerance. This choice can be rationalized by the fact that statin discontinuation and dose reduction can occur for multitude of reasons not related to intolerance, which are not possible to be identified from the administrative registry data without access to electronic health records. Thus, statin switching is more likely to represent general statin intolerance but it can also be related to lack of efficacy. Consequently, we found it important to include an intolerance phenotype where change in statin prescribing was temporally associated with another indicator for intolerance, namely a CK measurement. Even though CK measurement can be ordered in various clinical situations, it is typically measured when statin-induced myopathy is suspected. Furthermore, muscle symptoms without CK elevation are a much more common form of statin-related myotoxicity than muscle symptoms with CK elevation [[1](#R1)]. Therefore, we included any CK measurement regardless of result to include also milder cases of myalgia not associated with CK increase. However, it should be noted that in the double-blinded STOMP trial, 9.4% of subjects treated with high dose atorvastatin experienced myalgia, whereas 4.6% of those treated with placebo experienced myalgia even after rechallenge [[34](#R34)]. Thus, our latter phenotype is more likely to represent muscle symptom-based statin intolerance, even though it might not be possible to separate between true statin-induced myalgia and symptoms unrelated to statins. The interval of 365 days between statin purchases for censoring was chosen to be able to catch statin switches after a pause of the initial statin. Our statin intolerance phenotype definitions were corroborated by robust associations of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with both intolerance phenotypes in simvastatin users.\n\nIn addition to simvastatin, we observed that heterozygous or homozygous *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C carriers had a higher risk of pravastatin intolerance based on statin switching phenotype when compared to reference allele homozygotes. It is noteworthy that the effect was observed in our cohort with low-moderate pravastatin doses as 40 mg is the highest approved dose of pravastatin in Europe rather than 80 mg available in the USA. In a previous pharmacogenetic study of statin efficacy and safety, 143 patients received 10 mg/day pravastatin for 8 weeks followed by 40 mg/day for 8 weeks [[16](#R16)]. Of these patients, 31 experienced a composite adverse event of either premature discontinuation due to any side effect, myalgia, or muscle cramps, or CK elevation during the 16-week follow-up. The *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV showed no association with the composite adverse event. The median follow-up time in our study was more than 2 years in pravastatin initiators, which may partly explain the differing results. Although most statin-induced muscle symptoms occur during the first months of statin usage, myotoxicity can occur even years after statin initiation [[7](#R7)].\n\nWe observed no statistically significant increase in statin intolerance risk for atorvastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin with the studied genotypes. For atorvastatin, no signals were evident for genotype-driven increased risk in our cohort of 780 atorvastatin users who most often had 10 and 20 mg prescribed as a starting dose. An earlier meta-analysis of 13 studies with a total of 1550 patients found that the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV associates with atorvastatin-induced adverse effects [[15](#R15)]. Moreover, in two recent prospective observational studies with substantial sample sizes (870 and 1627), the SNV was associated with an increased risk of atorvastatin intolerance or atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms [[17](#R17),[32](#R32)]. In the former study, 90% of the patients were using 80 mg/day atorvastatin, which is a substantially higher proportion than in our study and may partly explain the differing results. Nevertheless, the non-significant HR of 1.25 to 1.3 for the statin switch + CK measurement phenotype in C-allele carriers in our study is close to the odds ratio of 1.44 for atorvastatin intolerance and HR of 1.4 for atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms in the previous studies [[11](#R11)\u2013[13](#R13),[17](#R17),[35](#R35)].\n\nThe rosuvastatin cohort consisted of only 184 patients who had most often 5 or 10 mg prescribed starting dose with no tendencies for increased risk in carriers of the candidate risk alleles. The findings are in line with the JUPITER trial in which the *SLCO1B1* genotype was not associated with clinically reported myalgia in a clinical trial setting with rosuvastatin dose of 20 mg [[36](#R36)]. The median follow-up time for rosuvastatin was relatively short, due to a recent increase in its use. This may diminish the sensitivity to identify genotype-intolerance associations.\n\nFor fluvastatin, there was a trend towards increased risk of statin intolerance with a point estimate of HR at 1.88 in carriers of 2\u20134 risk alleles, but perhaps due to low sample size, the finding was not statistically significant. A previous study in renal transplant recipients with 52 cases of fluvastatin-induced adverse muscular or liver symptoms and 52 matched controls, showed that the *CYP2C9*2* and **3* alleles and the *ABCG2* c.421C>A SNV significantly increase the risk of these adverse reactions, with odds ratios between 2.4 and 6.6 [[37](#R37)]. Our data suggest that these alleles as well as the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV may increase the risk of fluvastatin intolerance also among general hypercholesterolemic patients, but further studies are required to confirm the findings.\n\nOur study has some limitations mainly related to its epidemiological and retrospective nature. Obviously, some prescribing changes occurring in our study are not related to statin intolerance and cases of true intolerance cannot be identified from the data. In any case, the study answers the clinical question of how the studied genotypes are related to statin switching. Furthermore, we eliminated obvious causes of confounding in prescribing patterns due to administrative factors by excluding time frames where atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were switched to other statins due to changes in reimbursement policies. The study population consisted of biobank-consented patients with available DNA samples who initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. As the Helsinki Biobank became operational in 2015, the majority of the study subjects had initiated their statin therapy before giving biobank consent and samples to the biobank, presenting a possibility for immortal time bias. For the current study design, this is not of major concern, however, as the study outcome was not related to survival. Moreover, the genotype frequencies observed were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and match those reported for the Finnish population (Table [1](#T1)). Lastly, due to low sample size in the fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin cohorts, care is warranted in making conclusions based on the current study alone.\n\nThe current study has several clinical implications. First, it corroborates the well-characterized association of *SLCO1B1* genotype with simvastatin intolerance in a real-world setting. Second, despite limited numbers, the *SLCO1B1* genotype associated with pravastatin intolerance at a dose range of 20\u201340 mg, supporting the role of OATP1B1 activity in pravastatin adverse effects. Third, even though no statistically significant genotype associations were observed for atorvastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin, these results can be used in future meta-analyses and in compilation of clinically actionable pharmacogenetic guidelines.\n\nIn conclusion, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C genotype was associated with increased switching of simvastatin and pravastatin to other statins in an epidemiological biobank study. The intolerance phenotype derived from statin switching alone or combined with CK measurement appears to be suitable to evaluate statin intolerance. Further studies in larger populations are required to examine the pharmacogenetics of statin intolerance.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all study participants for their participation in the biobank research and the Helsinki Biobank for establishing the study cohort.\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the European Research Council (Grant agreement 725249), State funding for university-level health research, and the Sigrid Jus\u00e9lius Foundation (Helsinki, Finland).\n\n### Conflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n1.
