You are an expert pharmacogenomics researcher reading and extracting annotations from the following article

\n\n{article_text}\n\n

These are the following terms for which we need to extract values:

Term: Variant/Haplotypes
- Content: The specific genetic variant mentioned in the study
- Manual Process: Look for SNP IDs (rs numbers), star alleles (CYP2D6*4), or genotype combinations
- Example: rs2909451, CYP2C19*1, CYP2C19*2, *1/*18

Term: Gene
- Content: Gene symbol associated with the variant
- Manual Process: Find the gene name near the variant mention, use standard HUGO symbols
- Example: DPP4, CYP2C19, KCNJ11

Term: Drug(s)
- Content: Generic drug name(s) studied
- Manual Process: Extract drug names from methods/results, use generic names, separate multiple drugs with commas
- Example: sitagliptin, clopidogrel, aspirin

Term: Phenotype Category
- Content: Type of clinical outcome studied
- Manual Process: Categorize based on what was measured:
    - Efficacy: Treatment response, clinical improvement
    - Metabolism/PK: Drug levels, clearance, half-life
    - Toxicity: Adverse events, side effects
    - Dosage: Dose requirements, dose adjustments
    - Other: Everything else
- Example: Efficacy (for HbA1c improvement study)

Term: Significance
- Content: Whether the association was statistically significant
- Manual Process: Look for p-values, confidence intervals:
    - yes: p < 0.05 or explicitly stated as significant
    - no: p ≥ 0.05 or stated as non-significant
    - not stated: No statistical testing mentioned
- Example: yes (P < .001 in sitagliptin study)

Term: Notes
- Content: Key study details, methodology, or important context
- Manual Process: Extract relevant quotes showing statistical results, study design, or important caveats
- Example: "Patients with the rs2909451 TT genotype in the study group exhibited a median HbA1c improvement of 0.57..."

Term: Standardized Sentence

- Content: Standardized description of the genetic association
- Manual Process: Write in format: "[Genotype/Allele] is [associated with/not associated with] [increased/decreased]
[outcome] [drug context] [population context]"
- Example: "Genotype TT is associated with decreased response to sitagliptin in people with Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2."

Term: Alleles

- Content: Specific allele or genotype if different from Variant/Haplotypes field
- Manual Process: Extract the exact genotype mentioned (AA, TT, CC, del/del, etc.)
- Example: TT, *1/*18, del/del

Term: Metabolizer types

- Content: CYP enzyme phenotype categories
- Manual Process: Look for metabolizer classifications in CYP studies:
    - poor metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, extensive metabolizer, ultrarapid metabolizer
- Example: intermediate metabolizer

Term: Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)

- Content: Reference genotype used for comparison
- Manual Process: Find what the study variant was compared against
- Example: *1/*1, C (for wild-type comparisons)

Term: Comparison Metabolizer types

- Content: Reference metabolizer status for comparison
- Manual Process: Extract the comparison metabolizer phenotype
- Example: normal metabolizer

Term: Specialty Population

- Content: Age-specific populations
- Manual Process: Check if study specifically focused on:
    - Pediatric: Children/adolescents
    - Geriatric: Elderly patients
    - Leave empty for general adult populations

Term: Population types
- Content: Descriptor of study population
- Manual Process: Look for population descriptors, usually "in people with" or ethnicity information
- Example: in people with

Term: Population Phenotypes or diseases
- Content: Disease/condition context with standardized prefix
- Manual Process: Find the medical condition studied, add appropriate prefix:
    - Disease: for established diseases
    - Other: for conditions/traits
    - Side Effect: for adverse events
- Example: Other:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

Term: isPlural
- Content: Grammar helper for sentence construction
- Manual Process: Use Is for singular subjects, Are for plural
- Example: Is

Term: Is/Is Not associated
- Content: Direction of association
- Manual Process: Determine if association was:
    - Associated with: Positive association found
    - Not associated with: No association found
- Example: Associated with

Term: Direction of effect

- Content: Whether the effect increases or decreases the outcome
- Manual Process: Look for directional language:
    - increased: Higher levels, better response, more effect
    - decreased: Lower levels, worse response, less effect
    - Leave empty if no clear direction
- Example: decreased

Term: PD/PK terms

- Content: Pharmacological outcome descriptor
- Manual Process: Extract the specific outcome measured:
    - response to, concentrations of, metabolism of, clearance of, dose of
- Example: response to

Term: Multiple drugs And/or

- Content: Logical connector for multiple drugs
- Manual Process: If multiple drugs mentioned:
    - and: All drugs together
    - or: Any of the drugs
    - Leave empty for single drug

Term: Multiple phenotypes or diseases And/or

- Content: Logical connector for multiple conditions
- Manual Process: Similar to drugs, use and/or for multiple conditions
- Leave empty for single condition

General recommended strategies

1. Scan for genetic variants: Look for "rs" numbers, gene names with asterisks, or phrases like "genotype," "allele,"
"polymorphism"
2. Identify drug context: Find drug names in methods, results, or discussion sections
3. Locate outcome measures: Look for clinical endpoints, lab values, response rates, adverse events
4. Find statistical associations: Search for p-values, odds ratios, significant differences between genotype groups
5. Extract population details: Note the study population, disease context, and inclusion criteria
6. Standardize the relationship: Convert the finding into the standardized sentence format following the association pattern
