## CRITICAL: var_pheno vs var_drug Task Selection

**THIS TASK (var_pheno) IS FOR:**
- Variants associated with PHENOTYPES (side effects, adverse reactions, disease susceptibility)
- HLA alleles linked to drug hypersensitivity syndromes (SJS/TEN, DRESS, MPE)
- Genetic variants affecting CLINICAL OUTCOMES of drug exposure
- Focus: What HAPPENS to the patient (the phenotype)

**DO NOT USE var_pheno FOR:**
- Variants affecting drug METABOLISM (plasma levels, clearance, AUC)
- CYP/transporter variants affecting PHARMACOKINETICS
- Studies measuring drug concentrations or metabolic ratios
- Focus: What happens to the DRUG (metabolism/PK belongs in var_drug task)

### Decision Examples

| Scenario | Correct Task | Reason |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| HLA-B*57:01 + abacavir → hypersensitivity | **var_pheno** | Phenotype = hypersensitivity reaction |
| HLA-B*15:02 + carbamazepine → SJS/TEN | **var_pheno** | Phenotype = Stevens-Johnson Syndrome |
| HLA-A*31:01 + carbamazepine → MPE | **var_pheno** | Phenotype = Maculopapular Exanthema |
| CYP2D6*4 + codeine → reduced metabolism | var_drug | Drug metabolism affected |
| SLCO1B1*5 + simvastatin → higher plasma levels | var_drug | Drug PK affected |
| CYP2C19*2 + clopidogrel → reduced efficacy | var_drug | Drug response affected |

**Rule of thumb**: If the association involves HLA alleles and a clinical syndrome (hypersensitivity, SJS, DRESS, etc.), it belongs in var_pheno.

      "Comparison Allele(s) or Genotype(s)": null,
      "Comparison Metabolizer types": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## CRITICAL: Annotation Granularity

**ONE ANNOTATION PER VARIANT/HAPLOTYPE**

When a table or text lists multiple variants/alleles with the same association, create a **SEPARATE annotation for EACH variant**.

### Example - Table Extraction

If the article contains a table like:

| HLA Allele | OR [95% CI] | P-value |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| HLA-B*35:05 | 2.32 [1.42-3.79] | 0.001 |
| HLA-B*51:01 | 2.32 [1.42-3.79] | 0.001 |
| HLA-B*67:01 | 2.32 [1.42-3.79] | 0.001 |

**WRONG** - Single consolidated annotation:
```json
{
  "Variant/Haplotypes": "HLA-B*35:05, HLA-B*51:01, HLA-B*67:01",
  "Gene": "HLA-B",
  ...
}
```

**CORRECT** - Three separate annotations:
```json
[
  {"Variant Annotation ID": 1, "Variant/Haplotypes": "HLA-B*35:05", "Gene": "HLA-B", ...},
  {"Variant Annotation ID": 2, "Variant/Haplotypes": "HLA-B*51:01", "Gene": "HLA-B", ...},
  {"Variant Annotation ID": 3, "Variant/Haplotypes": "HLA-B*67:01", "Gene": "HLA-B", ...}
]
```

### Table Extraction Strategy

1. **Scan all tables** in the article for variant/allele data
2. **Extract each row** as a separate annotation
3. **Do not consolidate** multiple variants into one entry
4. **Preserve the exact allele format** from the table (e.g., HLA-B*35:05, not just *35:05)

### CRITICAL: Expand Grouped Allele Notation

Tables often group alleles using parentheses notation. **EXPAND these into separate annotations.**

| Grouped Notation | Expand To |
|-----------------|-----------|
| HLA-B*51:(01/02) | HLA-B*51:01 AND HLA-B*51:02 (2 entries) |
| HLA-B*15:(01/12/24/25/27/32/35) | 7 separate entries: HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*15:12, HLA-B*15:24, etc. |
| HLA-B*55:(01/02) | HLA-B*55:01 AND HLA-B*55:02 (2 entries) |
| HLA-C*04:(01/03/06/07) | 4 entries: HLA-C*04:01, HLA-C*04:03, HLA-C*04:06, HLA-C*04:07 |

**Example from table row:**
```
| Risk B07 alleles HLA-B*35:05, -B*39:10, -B*51:(01/02), -B*54:01 | 2.32 | 0.001 |
```
This becomes **5 separate annotations**:
1. HLA-B*35:05
2. HLA-B*39:10
3. HLA-B*51:01 (expanded from -B*51:(01/02))
4. HLA-B*51:02 (expanded from -B*51:(01/02))
5. HLA-B*54:01

### Common Table Patterns to Extract

- HLA allele association tables (expand grouped notation!)
- SNP/rsID association results tables
- Star allele (*1, *2, etc.) frequency tables
- Genotype distribution tables

## Critical Field Alignment Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Several fields must be aligned with each other for consistency.

### Phenotype Category ↔ Phenotype Prefix Alignment

| Phenotype Category | Phenotype Prefix | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| `toxicity` | `Side Effect:` | `Side Effect:Stevens-Johnson Syndrome` |
| `efficacy` | `Efficacy:` | `Efficacy:Overall survival` |
| `metabolism/PK` | `PK:` | `PK:Drug clearance` |
| `other` | `Disease:` or `Other:` | `Disease:Drug Hypersensitivity` |
| `dosage` | `Other:` | `Other:Dose requirement` |
| `PD` | `Other:` | `Other:Response` |

### Drug(s) ↔ When treated with Alignment

| Drug(s) Value | When treated with Value |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Has drug name(s) | **MUST have value** (default: `when treated with`) |
| Empty | Can be null |

## Field Definitions

### Variant/Haplotypes - STRICT FORMAT

**Use specific genetic identifiers ONLY. NEVER use metabolizer descriptions.**

**Priority order:**
1. **rs numbers (rsID)** - Always prefer: rs1801272, rs4149056
2. **Star alleles** - With gene prefix: CYP2D6*1, CYP2D6*2, UGT1A1*28
3. **HLA alleles** - Full format: HLA-B*35:08, HLA-A*31:01
4. **Genotype combinations** - Specific alleles: *1/*28, CC, TT

**NEVER use:**
- "poor metabolizer", "intermediate metabolizer", "extensive metabolizer"
- "slow metabolizers", "fast metabolizers"
- Generic descriptions like "variant carriers"

**If article groups by metabolizer status but lists specific alleles tested, use the star alleles:**
- WRONG: "poor or intermediate metabolizers"
- CORRECT: "CYP2D6*3, CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*5, CYP2D6*6"

- **Extract EACH variant separately from tables**

### Gene
- HGNC gene symbol: HLA-B, CYP2A6, UGT1A1

### Drug(s)
- Drug names involved in the phenotype
- Empty for disease susceptibility studies without drug

### PMID
- PubMed identifier from the article

### Phenotype Category (LOWERCASE)

  - `dosage` - Dose requirements
  - `PD` - Pharmacodynamics
  - `other` - Disease susceptibility, other traits

### Significance
- **Valid values**: `yes`, `no`, `not stated`

### Notes

### Is/Is Not associated - EXACT VALUES REQUIRED
- **Valid values (exact match)**:
  - `Associated with` - Positive association found
  - `Not associated with` - No association found
  - null - If unclear

### Direction of effect - LOWERCASE REQUIRED
- **Valid values (lowercase only)**:
  - `increased` - Higher risk, more severe
  - `decreased` - Lower risk, less severe
  - null - If no clear direction

**WRONG**: "Increased", "INCREASED"
**CORRECT**: "increased"

### Side effect/efficacy/other
- **Valid values**:
  - `likelihood of`
  - `risk of`
  - `severity of`
  - `age at onset of`

### Phenotype - MANDATORY PREFIX FORMAT

**CRITICAL**: Every phenotype MUST have a category prefix separated by colon.

**Format**: `[Category]:[Phenotype Name]`

**Prefixes:**
- `Side Effect:` - Adverse reactions, toxicity, side effects
- `Efficacy:` - Treatment response, survival outcomes
- `Disease:` - Disease conditions, susceptibility
- `Other:` - Other traits/conditions

**Multiple phenotypes** - Each with its own prefix:
- `Side Effect:Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Side Effect:Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis`
- `Efficacy:Overall survival, Efficacy:Progression-free survival`

### Multiple phenotypes And/or
- `and` - All phenotypes together
- `or` - Any phenotype individually

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Putting HLA+hypersensitivity in var_drug | Use var_pheno for phenotype associations |
| Consolidating table variants into one annotation | Create separate annotation for each variant |
| `"Stevens-Johnson Syndrome"` | `"Side Effect:Stevens-Johnson Syndrome"` |
| `"Increased"` | `"increased"` |
| `"associated with"` | `"Associated with"` |
| Drug present but "When treated with" empty | Add `"when treated with"` |
| `Phenotype Category: "Toxicity"` | `"toxicity"` |

## Now Extract

Read the provided PubMed article carefully. **Scan all tables** for variant associations and extract **each variant as a separate annotation**.

**Remember**: This task is for PHENOTYPE associations (side effects, adverse reactions, hypersensitivity). Drug metabolism/PK associations belong in var_drug.

Follow the above guidelines and return only the JSON output with all extracted entries.
