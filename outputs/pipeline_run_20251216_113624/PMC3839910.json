    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the association of HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 genetic variants with carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced hypersensitivity reactions in a pediatric population from Canada with diverse ethnic backgrounds. The researchers enrolled 42 children with CBZ hypersensitivity reactions (including 9 with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [SJS/TEN], 6 with drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome [HSS], 26 with maculopapular exanthems [MPE], and 1 with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) and 91 CBZ-tolerant controls. Key findings showed that HLA-A*31:01 was significantly associated with CBZ-HSS (OR: 26.4, p=0.0025) and MPE (OR: 8.6, p=0.0037), but not with SJS/TEN. Conversely, HLA-B*15:02 was associated with CBZ-SJS/TEN (OR: 38.6, p=0.002) but not with HSS or MPE. All HLA-B*15:02-positive patients with SJS/TEN were of Asian origin. The study demonstrated that HLA-A*31:01 is relevant across various ancestries including European, Aboriginal, and Latin American populations. This is the first study to demonstrate the association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ hypersensitivity specifically in children, supporting the clinical utility of predictive HLA genotyping to identify pediatric patients at increased risk for severe CBZ-induced hypersensitivity reactions.",
