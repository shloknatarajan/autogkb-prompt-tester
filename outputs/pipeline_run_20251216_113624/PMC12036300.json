    "summary": "This prospective cohort study investigated CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms in 50 Syrian coronary artery disease (CAD) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who received dual antiplatelet therapy with a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel (150 mg/day). The researchers determined allele frequencies of CYP2C19*2 (8%), *3 (0%), and *17 (17%) using PCR and Sanger sequencing. The metabolizer phenotype distribution was: normal metabolizers (56%), intermediate metabolizers (26%), rapid metabolizers (12%), and ultra-rapid metabolizers (2%). During 18-24 months of follow-up, no significant association was found between CYP2C19*2 carrier status and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or between CYP2C19*17 and bleeding complications. The authors suggest that doubling the clopidogrel maintenance dose may help overcome reduced drug efficacy in CYP2C19*2 carriers (intermediate metabolizers), potentially supporting genotype-guided dosing strategies. This is the first study reporting CYP2C19 allele frequencies in the Syrian population, which showed frequencies comparable to other Middle Eastern and North African populations. The study's main limitations include small sample size and lack of platelet function testing. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.",
