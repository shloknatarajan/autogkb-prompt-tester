    "summary": "This study investigated the association between genetic variants in NUDT15 and TPMT genes and thiopurine (6-mercaptopurine) toxicity in Colombian pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during maintenance therapy. Seventy patients were enrolled, and genotyping was performed using TaqMan PCR for SNPs rs116855232 (NUDT15), rs1800462, rs1800460, and rs1142345 (TPMT). Results showed 4/68 patients were heterozygous for NUDT15, 4/68 for rs1800462, 6/68 for rs1800460, and 4/42 for rs1142345. All variants were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The allelic frequencies differed from those reported in Asian populations and some Latin American studies. No statistically significant associations were found between any genetic variants and clinical outcomes including myelotoxicity (25%), liver toxicity (27%), 6-MP dose reduction (32.9%), febrile neutropenia, relapse, or death. The authors attribute the lack of significant associations to the small sample size and the unique genetic admixture of the Colombian population (approximately 50-60% European ancestry). This is the first pharmacogenomic study of TPMT and NUDT15 variants in Colombian ALL patients, highlighting the need for larger multicenter studies and evaluation of population-specific biomarkers for thiopurine toxicity prediction.",
