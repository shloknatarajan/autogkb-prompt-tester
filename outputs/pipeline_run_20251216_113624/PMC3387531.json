    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated genetic variants associated with nevirapine-induced cutaneous and hepatic adverse events in HIV-infected adults of African, Asian, and European descent. The retrospective case-control study enrolled 276 cases (175 cutaneous, 101 hepatic adverse events) and 587 controls matched on CD4 T-cell count, sex, and race. Participants with \u2264150 CD4 T cells/\u03bcl were excluded. Researchers genotyped 123 HLA alleles and 2,744 SNPs in MHC and drug metabolism genes.\n\nKey findings showed that cutaneous adverse events were associated with CYP2B6 516G\u2192T (OR 1.66 overall), HLA-Cw*04 (OR 2.51 overall), and HLA-B*35 (OR 3.47 in Asians, 5.65 in Thais). Risk was particularly elevated in Blacks with CYP2B6 516TT and HLA-Cw*04 (OR 18.90) and Asians with HLA-B*35 and HLA-Cw*04 (OR 18.34). Hepatic adverse events were associated with HLA-DRB1*01 (OR 3.02 in Whites) but not CYP2B6 genotypes.\n\nThe study suggests fundamentally different mechanisms: cutaneous reactions appear MHC class I-mediated and influenced by CYP2B6 metabolism, while hepatic reactions appear MHC class II-mediated and unaffected by such metabolism. This is the first study demonstrating CYP2B6 variants affect nevirapine adverse event risk. However, these genetic variants lack sensitivity for routine clinical screening, as many adverse event cases lacked identified risk alleles.",
