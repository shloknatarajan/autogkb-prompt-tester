    "summary": "This landmark pharmacogenomics study investigated genetic markers for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) caused by allopurinol, a commonly prescribed medication for gout and hyperuricemia. SCAR includes drug hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which are unpredictable and carry significant morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe researchers conducted a case-control association study enrolling 51 Han Chinese patients with allopurinol-SCAR and 228 controls (135 allopurinol-tolerant subjects and 93 healthy subjects from the general population). They genotyped 823 SNPs in genes related to drug metabolism and immune response.\n\nInitial screening revealed strong associations between allopurinol-SCAR and SNPs in the MHC region, including BAT3, MSH5, and MICB genes (P < 10\u207b\u2077). Subsequent HLA genotyping revealed a striking finding: the HLA-B*5801 allele was present in 100% (51/51) of patients with allopurinol-SCAR, compared to only 15% of tolerant patients (odds ratio 580.3; corrected P = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2074) and 20% of healthy subjects (odds ratio 393.5; corrected P = 8.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2078).\n\nAdditional HLA alleles (A*3303, Cw*0302, and DRB1*0301) were found in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*5801, forming an extended haplotype. Chronic renal insufficiency was also identified as a risk factor (4.7-fold increased risk).\n\nThe study concluded that HLA-B*5801 is a necessary but not sufficient genetic risk factor for allopurinol-induced SCAR in Han Chinese, suggesting that genetic screening before allopurinol prescription could help prevent these life-threatening adverse reactions.",
