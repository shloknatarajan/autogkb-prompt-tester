    "summary": "This case report describes a 41-year-old South Asian female with acute promyelocytic leukemia who developed severe thiopurine toxicity after starting maintenance therapy with mercaptopurine. Seven weeks after initiation, she presented with severe pancytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and extensive alopecia. Genetic testing revealed wildtype TPMT alleles but homozygous loss-of-function NUDT15 *3/*3 alleles (c.415C>T), resulting in complete loss of NUDT15 protein function. The patient required supportive care including transfusions and filgrastim, and mercaptopurine was permanently discontinued. The authors highlight that NUDT15 and TPMT are key enzymes in thiopurine metabolism that convert active thioguanine nucleotides into non-cytotoxic byproducts. Loss-of-function mutations lead to accumulation of toxic metabolites. Importantly, NUDT15 mutations are more prevalent in Asian and Hispanic populations (21% heterozygous, 2% homozygous) compared to TPMT mutations in European and African populations (10% heterozygous, 0.3% homozygous). Despite this, clinical guidelines inconsistently recommend NUDT15 testing, particularly in gastroenterology. The case emphasizes that alopecia may be an early warning sign of thiopurine toxicity and underscores the need for race-informed pharmacogenomic testing strategies.",
