    "summary": "This preliminary pharmacogenomics study investigated how genetic variants influence escitalopram pharmacokinetics and adverse events in 66 youth (ages 12-17) with depression and/or anxiety who had a first-degree relative with bipolar I disorder. Participants were treated with escitalopram and underwent pharmacogenetic testing for CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, and SLC6A4 genes, with 48 also providing blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\nKey findings include: (1) CYP2C19 phenotype significantly influenced escitalopram pharmacokinetics, with slower metabolizers showing greater AUC0-24 (p=0.025), trough concentrations (p=0.013), and elimination half-lives (p<0.001), but CYP2C19 was not associated with adverse events; (2) CYP2D6 phenotype did not affect pharmacokinetic parameters but slower CYP2D6 metabolizers had increased akathisia scores (p=0.015); (3) HTR2A A/A and A/G genotypes were associated with increased self-injury, suicidality, and harm to others subscale scores (p=0.017); (4) SLC6A4 genotype showed no significant associations with clinical outcomes.\n\nThe authors propose that CYP2D6's role in metabolizing desmethylescitalopram (DCT), an active metabolite with distinct pharmacodynamic properties, may explain the adverse event associations despite no pharmacokinetic effects on escitalopram itself. Study limitations include small sample size, few extreme metabolizer phenotypes, and no correction for multiple comparisons. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings for clinical application in personalized medicine approaches.",
