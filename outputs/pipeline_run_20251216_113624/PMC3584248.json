    "summary": "This exploratory pharmacogenomics study examined the relationship between CYP2D6 genotypes, endoxifen plasma concentrations, and breast cancer recurrence in 224 Filipino and Vietnamese women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for operable breast cancer. The researchers genotyped patients for CYP2D6 alleles (*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *10, and *41) and measured plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites using LC-MS/MS. The CYP2D6*10 allele was most prevalent in both populations (58.5% Vietnamese, 52.4% Filipino). Results confirmed a significant association between reduced CYP2D6 function and lower endoxifen concentrations (p<0.0001 for trend), though CYP2D6 genotype explained only 10% of endoxifen variability. In a nested case-control study of 48 patients (24 with recurrence, 24 matched controls), an unexpected J-shaped relationship emerged: both low and high endoxifen concentrations (>70 ng/ml) were associated with increased recurrence risk (likelihood ratio p=0.002). Among patients with low endoxifen levels, 8 of 9 recurrent cases had lower levels than matched controls. The authors suggest there may be an optimal therapeutic range for endoxifen, with concentrations above 70 ng/ml potentially promoting recurrence. This finding has implications for tamoxifen dosing optimization and ongoing clinical trials of oral endoxifen.",
