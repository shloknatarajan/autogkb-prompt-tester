    "summary": "This study presents the 96-week pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenetic analysis of the ENCORE1 trial, which compared reduced-dose efavirenz (400 mg, EFV400) versus standard-dose (600 mg, EFV600) in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected adults. The analysis included 606 patients (32% female; 37% African, 33% Asian) and examined relationships between EFV pharmacokinetics, genetic polymorphisms (CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, NR1I3, NR1I2, ABCB1), and clinical outcomes. Key findings showed that EFV pharmacokinetic parameters, including mid-dose interval concentration (C12), were not associated with achieving viral suppression (<200 copies/mL) at 96 weeks. None of the SNPs assessed predicted virological failure. For safety outcomes, EFV600 was associated with higher rates of EFV-related adverse events and discontinuations due to these events (OR 2.54). CNS adverse events were not driven by dose or concentrations, but CYP2B6 983TC/CC carriers had 35% lower risk while CYP2B6 15582CT/TT and ABCB1 3435TT carriers had 46% and 131% higher risk, respectively. The study questioned the validity of the currently accepted minimum effective concentration of 1.0 mg/L, finding that C12 values between 0.47-0.76 mg/L provided >90% sensitivity/specificity for viral suppression. The authors conclude that EFV400 implementation would improve toxicity management while maintaining efficacy.",
