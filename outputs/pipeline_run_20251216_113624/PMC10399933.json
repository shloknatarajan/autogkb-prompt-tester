    "summary": "This register-based cohort study investigated the pharmacogenetic associations of SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 variants with statin intolerance in 2,042 Finnish patients who initiated statin therapy between 1998-2016. Data from the Helsinki Biobank was linked with national drug purchase registries and clinical chemistry measurements. Statin intolerance was defined as switching from the initial statin to another, with a secondary phenotype combining switching with temporally related creatine kinase (CK) measurements. The study confirmed that SLCO1B1 c.521C/C genotype significantly increased simvastatin intolerance risk using both the statin switching phenotype (HR 1.88, P=0.025) and the combined switching plus CK measurement phenotype (HR 5.44, P=0.011). Additionally, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C carriers showed increased pravastatin intolerance risk (HR 2.11, P=0.047). No significant associations were found for atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin with the studied genetic variants, though sample sizes for some statins were limited. Higher simvastatin doses (\u226540mg) were also associated with increased intolerance. The findings support existing CPIC guidelines for SLCO1B1-guided simvastatin prescribing and suggest OATP1B1 activity may also influence pravastatin adverse effects. The methodology using statin switching as an intolerance marker proved feasible for pharmacogenetic studies using real-world data.",
