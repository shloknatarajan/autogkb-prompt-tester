    "summary": "This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized clinical trial (PLATELET trial) investigated the association between CYP2C19 genotypes and cardiovascular outcomes in 2,910 Korean patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel. Patients were classified as carriers (61.3%) or noncarriers (38.7%) of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles. The primary outcome was cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death) within 6 months. Results showed that LOF allele carriers had significantly higher rates of cardiovascular events compared to noncarriers (2.7% vs 1.6%; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-1.00; P=0.048). Stroke recurrence was also more frequent in carriers (2.5% vs 1.4%; P=0.047). No significant differences were observed in major bleeding (0.6% vs 0.8%) or all-cause mortality between groups. Multivariable analysis confirmed that LOF allele noncarrier status was protective against cardiovascular events. The study supports that CYP2C19 genotyping may help personalize antiplatelet therapy, particularly in Asian populations where LOF allele prevalence is high (~60%). Alternative antiplatelet agents like ticagrelor may be more effective for LOF allele carriers.",
