    "summary": "This landmark pharmacogenomics study investigated genetic markers for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) caused by allopurinol, a commonly prescribed medication for gout and hyperuricemia. SCAR includes drug hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which are unpredictable and carry significant morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe researchers conducted a case-control association study enrolling 51 Han Chinese patients with allopurinol-SCAR and 228 controls (135 allopurinol-tolerant subjects and 93 healthy subjects from the general population). They genotyped 823 SNPs in genes related to drug metabolism and immune response.\n\nInitial screening revealed strong associations between allopurinol-SCAR and SNPs in the MHC region, including BAT3, MSH5, and MICB genes (P < 10\u207b\u2077). Subsequent HLA genotyping revealed a striking finding: the HLA-B*5801 allele was present in 100% (51/51) of patients with allopurinol-SCAR, compared to only 15% of tolerant patients (odds ratio 580.3; corrected P = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2074) and 20% of healthy subjects (odds ratio 393.5; corrected P = 8.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2078).\n\nAdditional HLA alleles (A*3303, Cw*0302, and DRB1*0301) were found in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*5801, forming an extended haplotype. Chronic renal insufficiency was also identified as a risk factor (4.7-fold increased risk).\n\nThe study concluded that HLA-B*5801 is a necessary but not sufficient genetic risk factor for allopurinol-induced SCAR in Han Chinese, suggesting that genetic screening before allopurinol prescription could help prevent these life-threatening adverse reactions.",

    "summary": "This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized clinical trial (PLATELET trial) investigated the association between CYP2C19 genotypes and cardiovascular outcomes in 2,910 Korean patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel. Patients were classified as carriers (61.3%) or noncarriers (38.7%) of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles. The primary outcome was cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death) within 6 months. Results showed that LOF allele carriers had significantly higher rates of cardiovascular events compared to noncarriers (2.7% vs 1.6%; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-1.00; P=0.048). Stroke recurrence was also more frequent in carriers (2.5% vs 1.4%; P=0.047). No significant differences were observed in major bleeding (0.6% vs 0.8%) or all-cause mortality between groups. Multivariable analysis confirmed that LOF allele noncarrier status was protective against cardiovascular events. The study supports that CYP2C19 genotyping may help personalize antiplatelet therapy, particularly in Asian populations where LOF allele prevalence is high (~60%). Alternative antiplatelet agents like ticagrelor may be more effective for LOF allele carriers.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the relationship between CYP2D6 metabolism and clinical outcomes in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer enrolled in the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial 8 (ABCSG 8). The trial randomized patients to either 5 years of tamoxifen (Arm A) or 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of anastrozole (Arm B). CYP2D6 is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for converting tamoxifen to its active metabolite endoxifen.\n\nUsing a matched case-control design, researchers genotyped CYP2D6 alleles (*3, *4, *6, *10, *41) associated with poor (PM), intermediate (IM), or extensive (EM) metabolism. The common *4 allele was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, addressing quality concerns raised about previous negative studies.\n\nKey findings showed that in Arm A (tamoxifen only), women with PM/PM genotype had significantly higher odds of disease events compared to EM/EM (OR=2.45, p=0.04). Women with one poor allele (PM/IM or PM/EM) showed a trend toward higher event likelihood (OR=1.67, p=0.07). Importantly, no association between CYP2D6 genotype and outcomes was observed in Arm B patients who switched to anastrozole. During years 3-5, PM/PM patients on continued tamoxifen showed increased event risk (OR=2.40, p=0.09), while those who switched to anastrozole did not (OR=0.28, p=0.23).\n\nThe study concludes that the negative effects of reduced CYP2D6 metabolism on tamoxifen efficacy are observed only during tamoxifen administration and are negated by switching to anastrozole, which is not metabolized by CYP2D6.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated genetic variants associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in 82 Chilean patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. The researchers analyzed 16 genetic variants in genes involved in drug metabolism and transport (TYMS, TYMP, DPYD, GSTP1, MTHFR, ERCC2, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC4, and ABCG2) using a retrospective nested case-control design. Key findings included: the GSTP1 rs1695 G allele was protective against neuropathy (OR=0.147, p=0.012) but increased mucositis risk (OR=2.27, p=0.036); the DPYD rs1801265 C allele was associated with higher neuropathy risk (OR=4.58, p=0.05); the TYMS 3'UTR deletion (rs11280056) protected against hematological ADRs (OR=0.029, p=0.001); and the TYMS 5'UTR 3R genotype (rs45445694) increased risk of skin disorders (OR=6.40, p=0.029). Two multivariate predictive models were developed: one for anemia risk incorporating TYMP rs11479 and ABCB1 rs1045642 (p=0.027, AUC=0.71), and another for pain risk using MTHFR rs1801131 and ERCC2 rs13181 (p=0.01, AUC=0.75). The study provides a foundation for developing pharmacogenetic-based predictive models to improve chemotherapy safety in Chilean colorectal cancer patients through personalized dose adjustments.",

The researchers conducted fine recombinant genetic mapping in 248 abacavir-exposed individuals from the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, identifying 18 definite hypersensitivity cases (7.3%) and 230 tolerant controls. The study confirmed that HLA-B*5701 was present in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases versus 1.7% of controls (OR=960, P<0.00001). Through haplotype mapping within the 57.1 ancestral haplotype, researchers identified a susceptibility locus within the 14-kb Hsp70 gene cluster. A nonsynonymous polymorphism in Hsp70-Hom (M493T) combined with HLA-B*5701 was found in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases but only 0.4% of controls (OR=3,893, P<0.00001). Functional studies showed that abacavir-hypersensitive individuals demonstrated increased monocyte TNF expression in response to ex vivo abacavir stimulation, which was abrogated with CD8+ T cell depletion. The authors propose that both HLA-B*5701 and Hsp70-Hom M493T alleles are necessary for abacavir hypersensitivity development, likely mediated by an HLA-B*5701-restricted immune response. These findings suggest prospective genetic testing could reduce hypersensitivity prevalence from 8% to 0.4% and have significant clinical implications for managing abacavir-exposed HIV patients.",

    "summary": "This study investigated genetic markers for carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in European populations. While HLA-B*1502 is strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN) in Asian populations, it does not predict these reactions in Europeans. The researchers conducted a genome-wide association study using samples from 22 subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, 43 subjects with maculopapular exanthema, and 3,987 controls of European descent. They identified HLA-A*3101 (prevalence 2-5% in Northern Europeans) as significantly associated with hypersensitivity syndrome (P=3.5\u00d710\u207b\u2078). Replication in 145 additional subjects confirmed HLA-A*3101 as a risk factor for hypersensitivity syndrome (OR=12.41), maculopapular exanthema (OR=8.33), and SJS-TEN (OR=25.93). The presence of HLA-A*3101 increased hypersensitivity risk from 5.0% to 26.0%, while its absence reduced risk to 3.8%. The authors calculated that 83 patients would need screening to prevent one hypersensitivity case. This finding parallels HLA-B*5701 screening for abacavir hypersensitivity and suggests HLA-A*3101 testing could be clinically useful for carbamazepine prescribing in European populations.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated genetic risk factors for hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. The researchers conducted the first HLA allele and genome-wide association study (GWAS) specifically for pegaspargase hypersensitivity in racially diverse cohorts totaling 4,259 patients from three protocols (TXVI, AALL0232, and AALL0434). In patients of European ancestry (EA), the HLA haplotype DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02 showed the strongest association with pegaspargase hypersensitivity, with HLA-DQB1*02:02 being the most significant allele (P=3.8\u00d710\u207b\u2079, OR=2.14). This is notably the same haplotype previously associated with native (non-PEGylated) asparaginase reactions, despite different antigenic targets between the preparations. All genome-wide significant SNPs in EA patients mapped to class II HLA loci. In non-European ancestry patients, the rs9958628 variant in ARHGAP28 (a gene previously linked to immune response in children) showed the strongest genetic association (P=8.9\u00d710\u207b\u2079). The study also identified non-genetic risk factors including fewer intrathecal injections during induction (TXVI) and male sex (AALL0232). These findings demonstrate ancestry-specific differences in genetic predisposition to pegaspargase allergy and implicate both HLA loci and ARHGAP28 in hypersensitivity mechanisms.",

CYP3A4*3 was first identified in Chinese subject from Shanghai (Sata et al., 2000), and it has a prevalence of 0.5% in the Uygur population in northwest China (Jin et al., 2015). It involves a 1334T>C transition leading to a missense mutation with a Met445Thr substitution in exon 12. This SNP take place within an evolutionarily conserved heme-binding region (Sata et al., 2000), potentially inducing structural variations affecting enzymatic activity. This study confirmed this point: the increase in Km is larger than that of Vmax, resulting in a 64.99% decrease in CLint for CYP3A4*3 compared with CYP3A4*1."

    "summary": "This in vitro pharmacogenomics study investigated how 22 CYP3A4 genetic variants found in the Chinese Han population affect the metabolism of ticagrelor, an antiplatelet drug used for acute coronary syndrome. Ticagrelor's adverse effects (bleeding and dyspnea) correlate with its plasma concentration, and CYP3A4 is responsible for 95% of its metabolism. The researchers expressed 22 CYP3A4 variants in insect cells and incubated them with ticagrelor to measure the formation of its active metabolite AR-C124910XX using UHPLC-MS/MS. Key findings showed significant variation in intrinsic clearance (CLint) among variants: CYP3A4*11, *18, and *33 demonstrated higher activity than wild-type; four variants (*10, *23, *32, *34) showed similar activity; 14 variants showed reduced activity (1.48-75.11% of wild-type); and CYP3A4*30 showed no detectable activity. CYP3A4*17 and *24 exhibited severely reduced activity (>90% decrease). These findings have clinical implications for identifying poor metabolizers who may be at increased risk for adverse effects due to elevated ticagrelor concentrations, potentially requiring dose adjustments for safer therapeutic outcomes.",

    "summary": "This study investigated the contribution of rare genetic variants in the DPYD gene to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, which can cause severe toxicity in patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Using next-generation sequencing, researchers analyzed DPYD in 2,972 patients who were phenotyped for DPD activity using the dihydrouracil/uracil plasma ratio. Of these patients, 19.7% showed partial DPD deficiency. The study identified 30 distinct genetic variants in DPD-deficient patients, with 77% being rare (MAF <1%) and 58% of these predicted to be deleterious. The three clinically relevant rare variants (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T) showed strong associations with low DPD activity. Importantly, rare variants with MAF <1% were significantly enriched in patients with partial DPD deficiency (9.3% vs 3.2%, p<0.00001). When excluding known clinically relevant variants and focusing on those with CADD scores >15, rare deleterious variants remained more common in DPD-deficient patients (4.2% vs 1.6%, p<0.001). The findings demonstrate that rare DPYD variants account for a significant portion of interindividual DPD activity variability, suggesting that comprehensive NGS-based genotyping rather than targeted SNP testing should be considered for guiding personalized fluoropyrimidine therapy to prevent severe toxicity.",

    "summary": "This register-based cohort study investigated the pharmacogenetic associations of SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 variants with statin intolerance in 2,042 Finnish patients who initiated statin therapy between 1998-2016. Data from the Helsinki Biobank was linked with national drug purchase registries and clinical chemistry measurements. Statin intolerance was defined as switching from the initial statin to another, with a secondary phenotype combining switching with temporally related creatine kinase (CK) measurements. The study confirmed that SLCO1B1 c.521C/C genotype significantly increased simvastatin intolerance risk using both the statin switching phenotype (HR 1.88, P=0.025) and the combined switching plus CK measurement phenotype (HR 5.44, P=0.011). Additionally, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C carriers showed increased pravastatin intolerance risk (HR 2.11, P=0.047). No significant associations were found for atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin with the studied genetic variants, though sample sizes for some statins were limited. Higher simvastatin doses (\u226540mg) were also associated with increased intolerance. The findings support existing CPIC guidelines for SLCO1B1-guided simvastatin prescribing and suggest OATP1B1 activity may also influence pravastatin adverse effects. The methodology using statin switching as an intolerance marker proved feasible for pharmacogenetic studies using real-world data.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the contributions of genetic and non-genetic factors to stable warfarin dose variability in 250 Thai patients. The researchers genotyped four SNPs: VKORC1 -1639G>A, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2 rs2108622, and UGT1A1 rs887829 using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Key findings showed that patients with VKORC1 -1639G>A variant genotypes (GA and AA) required significantly lower warfarin doses compared to wild-type (GG), with the AA genotype requiring 49.7% lower doses. Similarly, CYP2C9*3 carriers needed significantly lower doses than wild-type patients. CYP4F2 rs2108622 TT genotype was associated with modestly higher dose requirements (1.2% contribution), while UGT1A1 rs887829 showed no significant association with dose variability. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that genetic factors (VKORC1 -1639G>A, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2 rs2108622) combined with non-genetic factors (age, BMI, antiplatelet drug use, amiodarone use, and current smoking status) explained 51.3% of warfarin dose variability. VKORC1 -1639G>A was the strongest predictor (26.2%), followed by age (10.8%) and CYP2C9*3 (6.0%). The study confirms that both genetic and clinical factors are important for predicting warfarin dose requirements in Thai patients.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the association between NLRP3 inflammasome gene polymorphisms (CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility, disease severity, and response to TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors (etanercept and infliximab) in 100 Iraqi RA patients and 100 healthy controls.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **Disease susceptibility**: Neither CARD8 rs2043211 nor NLRP3 rs4612666 polymorphisms showed significant association with RA susceptibility when comparing genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls.\n\n2. **Cytokine correlations**: Serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels were significantly elevated in RA patients compared to controls and positively correlated with disease activity (DAS-28 scores). Non-responders to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy had significantly higher cytokine levels.\n\n3. **Genotype-phenotype associations**: The TT genotypes of both CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 were significantly associated with higher DAS-28 scores, elevated TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels, more active disease course, and poorer response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy.\n\n4. **Treatment response**: Variant genotypes (T allele-bearing) of both SNPs were associated with lower response rates to anti-TNF-\u03b1 drugs. The recessive genetic models showed significant associations with higher disease activity and non-response to treatment.\n\n5. **Sex differences**: Males showed better clinical response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy compared to females.\n\nThe study concludes that while these polymorphisms may not predict RA susceptibility, they could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity and response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy in Iraqi RA patients.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the effects of CYP2B6 G516T polymorphisms on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations in 124 HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults receiving rifampicin-based TB therapy. Patients received either efavirenz (600 mg/day, n=65) or nevirapine (400 mg/day, n=59) based antiretroviral therapy. The CYP2B6-516TT genotype frequency was 13.85% in the efavirenz group and 3.39% in the nevirapine group. Key findings showed that patients with the TT genotype had significantly higher 12-hour post-dose plasma efavirenz concentrations at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation compared to GT or GG genotypes (p<0.0001). Similar trends were observed for nevirapine, though less pronounced due to small TT sample size. Importantly, rifampicin co-administration had only small effects on plasma drug levels compared to the substantial impact of the CYP2B6-516TT genotype. Patients with TT genotype showed a trend toward higher viral suppression rates at week 12. The study also examined CYP3A4 polymorphisms but found limited variation in the Thai population. The authors conclude that CYP2B6-516TT genotype significantly impacts plasma NNRTI concentrations, which may be useful for optimizing HIV/TB treatment.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the association of HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 genetic variants with carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced hypersensitivity reactions in a pediatric population from Canada with diverse ethnic backgrounds. The researchers enrolled 42 children with CBZ hypersensitivity reactions (including 9 with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [SJS/TEN], 6 with drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome [HSS], 26 with maculopapular exanthems [MPE], and 1 with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) and 91 CBZ-tolerant controls. Key findings showed that HLA-A*31:01 was significantly associated with CBZ-HSS (OR: 26.4, p=0.0025) and MPE (OR: 8.6, p=0.0037), but not with SJS/TEN. Conversely, HLA-B*15:02 was associated with CBZ-SJS/TEN (OR: 38.6, p=0.002) but not with HSS or MPE. All HLA-B*15:02-positive patients with SJS/TEN were of Asian origin. The study demonstrated that HLA-A*31:01 is relevant across various ancestries including European, Aboriginal, and Latin American populations. This is the first study to demonstrate the association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ hypersensitivity specifically in children, supporting the clinical utility of predictive HLA genotyping to identify pediatric patients at increased risk for severe CBZ-induced hypersensitivity reactions.",

Participants were treated with escitalopram and underwent pharmacogenetic testing for CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, and SLC6A4 genes, with 48 also providing blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\nKey findings include: (1) CYP2C19 phenotype significantly influenced escitalopram pharmacokinetics, with slower metabolizers showing greater AUC0-24 (p=0.025), trough concentrations (p=0.013), and elimination half-lives (p<0.001), but CYP2C19 was not associated with adverse events; (2) CYP2D6 phenotype did not affect pharmacokinetic parameters but slower CYP2D6 metabolizers had increased akathisia scores (p=0.015); (3) HTR2A A/A and A/G genotypes were associated with increased self-injury, suicidality, and harm to others subscale scores (p=0.017); (4) SLC6A4 genotype showed no significant associations with clinical outcomes.\n\nThe authors propose that CYP2D6's role in metabolizing desmethylescitalopram (DCT), an active metabolite with distinct pharmacodynamic properties, may explain the adverse event associations despite no pharmacokinetic effects on escitalopram itself. Study limitations include small sample size, few extreme metabolizer phenotypes, and no correction for multiple comparisons. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings for clinical application in personalized medicine approaches.",

    "summary": "This retrospective study investigated the safety and efficacy of individualized irinotecan dosing based on pre-treatment UGT1A1*6 genotyping in 110 advanced gastric cancer patients receiving second-line chemotherapy. Irinotecan doses were adjusted according to UGT1A1*6 polymorphism: 125 mg/m\u00b2 for GG (wild-type), 100 mg/m\u00b2 for GA (heterozygous), and 75 mg/m\u00b2 for AA (homozygous mutant) genotypes. The genotype frequencies were 60.9% GG, 31.8% GA, and 7.3% AA for UGT1A1*6, and 70.9% TA6/TA6, 25.5% TA6/TA7, and 3.6% TA7/TA7 for UGT1A1*28. Results showed no significant differences in progression-free survival (4.8 vs 4.9 vs 4.4 months) or overall survival (9.3 vs 9.3 vs NA months) among UGT1A1*6 genotype groups after dose adjustment. However, UGT1A1*6 polymorphism was significantly associated with delayed diarrhea (p=0.000), leukopenia (p=0.003), and neutropenia (p=0.000), while UGT1A1*28 showed no significant association with these toxicities. Patients with AA genotype experienced 100% grade 3/4 toxicity rates for diarrhea, leukopenia, and neutropenia despite dose reduction, leading 5 of 8 AA patients to switch to paclitaxel. The study concludes that genotype-guided irinotecan dosing shows encouraging outcomes for GG/GA patients, but irinotecan may not be suitable for AA genotype patients in East Asian populations.",

    "summary": "This retrospective cohort study investigated the association between CYP2D6 metabolizer status and adverse events (AEs) in pediatric patients treated with risperidone. Using BioVU, a DNA biobank linked to electronic health records at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, researchers identified 257 children (\u226418 years) with at least four weeks of risperidone exposure. Participants underwent CYP2D6 genotyping and were classified as poor (6%), intermediate (7%), normal (85%), or ultrarapid (2%) metabolizers. For analysis, patients were grouped as poor/intermediate metabolizers (n=33, 13%) versus normal/ultrarapid metabolizers (n=224, 87%). The study found that 30% of all children experienced AEs, with weight change (9%), sedation (6%), and extrapyramidal symptoms (6%) being most common. AEs were significantly more frequent in poor/intermediate metabolizers (46%) compared to normal/ultrarapid metabolizers (27%, P=0.04). After multivariate adjustment for age, sex, race, and initial dose, poor/intermediate metabolizers had 2.4-fold increased risk of AEs (95% CI 1.1-5.1, P=0.03). Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors did not significantly affect AE risk in normal/ultrarapid metabolizers. The authors conclude that pre-prescription CYP2D6 genotyping could identify high-risk children who may benefit from alternative therapy, dose reduction, or enhanced monitoring.",

    "summary": "This study developed a novel admixture-adjusted pharmacogenetic algorithm to refine warfarin dosing in Caribbean Hispanic patients. Using a derivation cohort of 255 patients from the Veterans Affairs Caribbean Healthcare System in Puerto Rico, researchers performed multiple linear regression analysis incorporating genotypes (CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2, NQO1), admixture metrics, and clinical/demographic factors. The resulting algorithm explained 70% of warfarin dose variability (MAE=0.72mg/day), outperforming a clinical non-genetic algorithm (R\u00b2=0.60, MAE=0.99mg/day) and two prior pharmacogenetic algorithms (IWPC and Lenzini models). For high-risk patients requiring low (\u22643mg/day) or high (\u22657mg/day) doses, 54.5% of predictions using the new model achieved ideal dosing compared to only 29% with the clinical algorithm. External validation in 55 independent patients confirmed the model's predictability (R\u00b2=58%, MAE=0.89mg/day). The study identified ethnic-specific variants including CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, and *11 alleles typically found in African ancestry populations, highlighting the genetic diversity in this admixed population. Results support incorporating individual genotypes and admixture metrics into pharmacogenetic models for admixed populations like Caribbean Hispanics to improve warfarin dosing accuracy.",

    "summary": "This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)/cotrimoxazole (CTX)-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). The authors searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases and included 6 case-control studies involving 322 patients with SCARs (236 with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [SJS/TEN] and 86 with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS]), along with 8,448 healthy controls and 229 tolerant controls. Populations studied included European, Japanese, Malaysian, Taiwanese, and Thai individuals.\n\nKey findings showed significant associations between SMX/CTX-induced SCARs and multiple HLA alleles when compared to tolerant controls: HLA-A*11:01 (OR 2.10), HLA-B*13:01 (OR 5.96), HLA-B*15:02 (OR 2.23), HLA-B*38:02 (OR 3.47), and HLA-C*08:01 (OR 2.63). Phenotype-specific associations were identified: HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*38:02 were associated with SJS/TEN, while HLA-A*68:01 and HLA-B*39:01 were associated with DRESS. HLA-B*13:01 showed associations with both SJS/TEN and DRESS. Geographic variation was observed, with HLA-B*13:01 showing associations across Malaysian, Taiwanese, and Thai populations, while HLA-B*38:01 and HLA-B*38:02 were associated with SCARs in European populations. These findings suggest multiple genetic factors contribute to SMX/CTX-induced SCARs pathogenesis.",

    "summary": "This retrospective study investigated the association between NUDT15 R139C (rs116855232) and TPMT*3C (rs1142345) polymorphisms and azathioprine (AZA)-induced leukopenia in 149 Chinese patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and related cirrhosis. Twelve patients (8.1%) developed leukopenia during AZA treatment. The NUDT15 rs116855232 T risk allele was strongly associated with leukopenia (OR=20.41, P<0.00001), with 91.67% sensitivity and 89.05% specificity. Leukopenia occurred in 37.5% of CT heterozygotes and 100% of TT homozygotes, compared to only 0.8% of CC wild-type patients. Patients with CT genotype had significantly higher 6-TGN concentrations and required lower maintenance doses (0.96 vs 1.23 mg/kg/day, P=0.028) compared to CC genotype patients. In contrast, TPMT*3C showed no significant association with leukopenia, likely due to its low frequency (1.7%) in this population. Notably, 13 patients with pre-existing leukopenia (likely due to cirrhosis/hypersplenism) did not experience progressive leukopenia on AZA if they had wild-type NUDT15. The study concludes that NUDT15 genotyping should be performed before AZA therapy in AIH patients, with dose adjustments recommended for heterozygous carriers.",

    "summary": "This study presents the 96-week pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenetic analysis of the ENCORE1 trial, which compared reduced-dose efavirenz (400 mg, EFV400) versus standard-dose (600 mg, EFV600) in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected adults. The analysis included 606 patients (32% female; 37% African, 33% Asian) and examined relationships between EFV pharmacokinetics, genetic polymorphisms (CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, NR1I3, NR1I2, ABCB1), and clinical outcomes. Key findings showed that EFV pharmacokinetic parameters, including mid-dose interval concentration (C12), were not associated with achieving viral suppression (<200 copies/mL) at 96 weeks. None of the SNPs assessed predicted virological failure. For safety outcomes, EFV600 was associated with higher rates of EFV-related adverse events and discontinuations due to these events (OR 2.54). CNS adverse events were not driven by dose or concentrations, but CYP2B6 983TC/CC carriers had 35% lower risk while CYP2B6 15582CT/TT and ABCB1 3435TT carriers had 46% and 131% higher risk, respectively. The study questioned the validity of the currently accepted minimum effective concentration of 1.0 mg/L, finding that C12 values between 0.47-0.76 mg/L provided >90% sensitivity/specificity for viral suppression. The authors conclude that EFV400 implementation would improve toxicity management while maintaining efficacy.",

    "summary": "This retrospective pharmacogenomics study investigated risk factors for adverse events in 36 Japanese patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil and L-leucovorin (nal-IRI/FL) therapy. The study focused on UGT1A1 polymorphisms (*6 and *28 variants), which affect the metabolism of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Patients were categorized by UGT1A1 genotype: 16 wild-type (-/-), 16 heterozygous (+/-), and 4 homozygous (+/+). Key findings showed that patients with UGT1A1*6 or *28 homozygous (+/+) genotype had significantly lower nadir counts of white blood cells (p=0.033) and neutrophils (p=0.043) compared to other genotypes. Multiple regression analysis identified three significant risk factors for leukopenia: UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) genotype (p=0.009), elevated pre-treatment AST levels (p=0.019), and pancreatic head cancer location (p=0.030). For neutropenia, only the UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) genotype was significantly associated (p=0.017). No significant risk factors were identified for diarrhea. The study concludes that patients with homozygous UGT1A1 variants require careful monitoring for myelosuppression during nal-IRI/FL treatment, and that liver function and tumor location may also influence toxicity risk.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the effects of genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters on steady-state plasma concentrations of simvastatin in 89 Thai patients with dyslipidemia or coronary artery disease. Researchers analyzed 10 SNPs across seven genes (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) using the MassARRAY System and measured simvastatin lactone (SVL) and simvastatin acid (SVA) concentrations via UHPLC-MS/MS. The key finding was that patients carrying the SLCO1B1 c.521TC+CC genotype had significantly higher SVA levels compared to those with c.521TT (0.53 vs. 0.19 ng/mL, p=0.03). Similarly, the SLCO1B1*1b/*15 diplotype was associated with elevated SVA concentrations compared to *1a/*1a (0.58 vs. 0.16 ng/mL, p<0.001). No significant associations were found between other pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms and simvastatin concentrations. The study confirms that SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (c.521T>C), either alone or combined with rs2306283 (c.388A>G), reduces OATP1B1 transporter function, leading to elevated simvastatin acid levels and potentially increased myotoxicity risk. These findings support the clinical utility of SLCO1B1 genotyping to guide statin therapy in Thai patients, consistent with CPIC guidelines.",

    "summary": "This study investigated the association between genetic variants in NUDT15 and TPMT genes and thiopurine (6-mercaptopurine) toxicity in Colombian pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during maintenance therapy. Seventy patients were enrolled, and genotyping was performed using TaqMan PCR for SNPs rs116855232 (NUDT15), rs1800462, rs1800460, and rs1142345 (TPMT). Results showed 4/68 patients were heterozygous for NUDT15, 4/68 for rs1800462, 6/68 for rs1800460, and 4/42 for rs1142345. All variants were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The allelic frequencies differed from those reported in Asian populations and some Latin American studies. No statistically significant associations were found between any genetic variants and clinical outcomes including myelotoxicity (25%), liver toxicity (27%), 6-MP dose reduction (32.9%), febrile neutropenia, relapse, or death. The authors attribute the lack of significant associations to the small sample size and the unique genetic admixture of the Colombian population (approximately 50-60% European ancestry). This is the first pharmacogenomic study of TPMT and NUDT15 variants in Colombian ALL patients, highlighting the need for larger multicenter studies and evaluation of population-specific biomarkers for thiopurine toxicity prediction.",

    "summary": "This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association between CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in HIV patients receiving nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), specifically efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP). The authors searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases, identifying 39 publications reporting genetic associations with antiretroviral DILI. The most frequently studied genes were UGT1A1, CYP2B6, ABCB1, HLA-Cw, and HLA-DRB1. Protein-protein interaction analysis identified CYP2B6 as a central node in the network. For the meta-analysis, three studies (795 patients) examined EFV-induced liver injury and two studies (820 patients) examined NVP-induced liver injury. Results showed that CYP2B6*6 carriers (poor metabolizers) had significantly increased risk of EFV-induced liver injury compared to normal metabolizers (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.24-3.01 for combined heterozygous and homozygous carriers). Conversely, CYP2B6*6 carriers showed reduced susceptibility to NVP-induced liver injury (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.84). The contrasting results between EFV and NVP may be explained by differences in metabolic pathways and toxic metabolite formation. The authors note limitations including small sample sizes and limited ethnic diversity (primarily African populations). This is the first meta-analysis examining CYP2B6 polymorphisms and ARVDILI, providing foundational knowledge for personalized medicine approaches in HIV treatment.",

    "summary": "This case report describes a 41-year-old South Asian female with acute promyelocytic leukemia who developed severe thiopurine toxicity after starting maintenance therapy with mercaptopurine. Seven weeks after initiation, she presented with severe pancytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and extensive alopecia. Genetic testing revealed wildtype TPMT alleles but homozygous loss-of-function NUDT15 *3/*3 alleles (c.415C>T), resulting in complete loss of NUDT15 protein function. The patient required supportive care including transfusions and filgrastim, and mercaptopurine was permanently discontinued. The authors highlight that NUDT15 and TPMT are key enzymes in thiopurine metabolism that convert active thioguanine nucleotides into non-cytotoxic byproducts. Loss-of-function mutations lead to accumulation of toxic metabolites. Importantly, NUDT15 mutations are more prevalent in Asian and Hispanic populations (21% heterozygous, 2% homozygous) compared to TPMT mutations in European and African populations (10% heterozygous, 0.3% homozygous). Despite this, clinical guidelines inconsistently recommend NUDT15 testing, particularly in gastroenterology. The case emphasizes that alopecia may be an early warning sign of thiopurine toxicity and underscores the need for race-informed pharmacogenomic testing strategies.",

    "summary": "This exploratory pharmacogenomics study examined the relationship between CYP2D6 genotypes, endoxifen plasma concentrations, and breast cancer recurrence in 224 Filipino and Vietnamese women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for operable breast cancer. The researchers genotyped patients for CYP2D6 alleles (*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *10, and *41) and measured plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites using LC-MS/MS. The CYP2D6*10 allele was most prevalent in both populations (58.5% Vietnamese, 52.4% Filipino). Results confirmed a significant association between reduced CYP2D6 function and lower endoxifen concentrations (p<0.0001 for trend), though CYP2D6 genotype explained only 10% of endoxifen variability. In a nested case-control study of 48 patients (24 with recurrence, 24 matched controls), an unexpected J-shaped relationship emerged: both low and high endoxifen concentrations (>70 ng/ml) were associated with increased recurrence risk (likelihood ratio p=0.002). Among patients with low endoxifen levels, 8 of 9 recurrent cases had lower levels than matched controls. The authors suggest there may be an optimal therapeutic range for endoxifen, with concentrations above 70 ng/ml potentially promoting recurrence. This finding has implications for tamoxifen dosing optimization and ongoing clinical trials of oral endoxifen.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated genetic variants associated with nevirapine-induced cutaneous and hepatic adverse events in HIV-infected adults of African, Asian, and European descent. The retrospective case-control study enrolled 276 cases (175 cutaneous, 101 hepatic adverse events) and 587 controls matched on CD4 T-cell count, sex, and race. Participants with \u2264150 CD4 T cells/\u03bcl were excluded. Researchers genotyped 123 HLA alleles and 2,744 SNPs in MHC and drug metabolism genes.\n\nKey findings showed that cutaneous adverse events were associated with CYP2B6 516G\u2192T (OR 1.66 overall), HLA-Cw*04 (OR 2.51 overall), and HLA-B*35 (OR 3.47 in Asians, 5.65 in Thais). Risk was particularly elevated in Blacks with CYP2B6 516TT and HLA-Cw*04 (OR 18.90) and Asians with HLA-B*35 and HLA-Cw*04 (OR 18.34). Hepatic adverse events were associated with HLA-DRB1*01 (OR 3.02 in Whites) but not CYP2B6 genotypes.\n\nThe study suggests fundamentally different mechanisms: cutaneous reactions appear MHC class I-mediated and influenced by CYP2B6 metabolism, while hepatic reactions appear MHC class II-mediated and unaffected by such metabolism. This is the first study demonstrating CYP2B6 variants affect nevirapine adverse event risk. However, these genetic variants lack sensitivity for routine clinical screening, as many adverse event cases lacked identified risk alleles.",

    "summary": "This prospective cohort study investigated CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms in 50 Syrian coronary artery disease (CAD) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who received dual antiplatelet therapy with a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel (150 mg/day). The researchers determined allele frequencies of CYP2C19*2 (8%), *3 (0%), and *17 (17%) using PCR and Sanger sequencing. The metabolizer phenotype distribution was: normal metabolizers (56%), intermediate metabolizers (26%), rapid metabolizers (12%), and ultra-rapid metabolizers (2%). During 18-24 months of follow-up, no significant association was found between CYP2C19*2 carrier status and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or between CYP2C19*17 and bleeding complications. The authors suggest that doubling the clopidogrel maintenance dose may help overcome reduced drug efficacy in CYP2C19*2 carriers (intermediate metabolizers), potentially supporting genotype-guided dosing strategies. This is the first study reporting CYP2C19 allele frequencies in the Syrian population, which showed frequencies comparable to other Middle Eastern and North African populations. The study's main limitations include small sample size and lack of platelet function testing. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the associations between SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms (388A>G and 521T>C) and hepatic function, baseline lipid levels, and lipid-lowering response to simvastatin in 542 Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia. The SLCO1B1 gene encodes OATP1B1, a hepatic transporter important for statin uptake and bile acid transport. Key findings include: (1) Patients with the 388AA genotype had significantly higher ALT and AST levels compared to those with 388AG or 388GG genotypes, suggesting an association with hepatic function markers; (2) The combination of 388AA and 521TT genotypes was associated with the highest ALT and AST levels; (3) Haplotype analysis showed that patients with abnormal liver enzyme levels had higher frequency of the 388A/521T haplotype and lower frequency of the 388G/521T haplotype; (4) Patients with the 388AA genotype had higher baseline HDL-C levels; (5) Carriers of the 388G allele with 521TT genotype showed greater TC and LDL-C reduction after 4 weeks of simvastatin treatment compared to 521C allele carriers; (6) No significant associations were found between SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and statin-induced creatine kinase elevations. The authors conclude that SLCO1B1 polymorphism interactions may be important genetic determinants of hepatic function and simvastatin therapeutic efficacy in Chinese hyperlipidemia patients.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the multiple HLA allele associations with cutaneous nevirapine (NVP) hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) in HIV-1 infected patients by examining similarities in peptide binding specificities and binding pocket structures of HLA molecules. The researchers analyzed 151 cases and 413 controls across Asian, African, and Caucasian ancestral groups using high-resolution HLA typing. Key findings include: (1) Primary predisposition to cutaneous NVP HSR is attributed to a cluster of HLA-C alleles (HLA-C*04:01, -C*05:01, -C*18:01) sharing a common F pocket structure, with HLA-C*04:01 showing consistent risk across all ethnic groups (OR=3.06, P=0.0001); (2) An independent secondary association was found with HLA-DRB1 class II alleles sharing a common P4 pocket (HLA-DRB1*01:01/02/03 and -DRB1*04:04/05/08/10); (3) Protection against NVP HSR was conferred by a cluster of HLA-B alleles (HLA-B*15:01/12/24/25/27/32/35 and -B*52:01) characterized by a specific B pocket structure. Molecular docking studies suggested NVP preferentially binds to the F pocket of HLA-C*04:01. The study demonstrates that drug-specific interactions within the HLA antigen binding cleft can be shared across HLA molecules with similar binding pockets, providing a mechanistic explanation for the multiple HLA associations observed in cutaneous NVP HSR and identifying novel risk and protective alleles.",

    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated long-term associations between genetic variants in pharmacogenes and clinical outcomes in 79 kidney transplant recipients over a 12-year follow-up period. The researchers analyzed 37 SNPs from 14 genes involved in drug metabolism and transport (ADME mechanisms) in both donors and recipients. Key findings include: (1) Variants in transporter genes ABCB1 and ABCC2 were significantly associated with 12-year survival after false discovery rate correction; (2) Increased tumor risk correlated with ABCC2 variants in donors, while CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT variant in recipients showed decreased risk; (3) Renal function was influenced by variants in ABCB1, ABCC2, CYP3A5, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6; (4) Tacrolimus dose-adjusted concentrations were affected by variants in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C19, ABCB1, and SLCO1B1; (5) CYP2C19 rs4244285 AA variant increased nephrotoxicity risk, while SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AA and AG variants reduced it; (6) Gene-gene interactions between metabolizer and transporter genes were also associated with altered clinical event risks. The study confirms CYP3A5 variants affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and supports pharmacogenetic testing for personalized immunosuppressive therapy management in kidney transplantation, though validation in larger cohorts is needed.",
