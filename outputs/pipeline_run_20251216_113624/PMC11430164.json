CYP3A4*3 was first identified in Chinese subject from Shanghai (Sata et al., 2000), and it has a prevalence of 0.5% in the Uygur population in northwest China (Jin et al., 2015). It involves a 1334T>C transition leading to a missense mutation with a Met445Thr substitution in exon 12. This SNP take place within an evolutionarily conserved heme-binding region (Sata et al., 2000), potentially inducing structural variations affecting enzymatic activity. This study confirmed this point: the increase in Km is larger than that of Vmax, resulting in a 64.99% decrease in CLint for CYP3A4*3 compared with CYP3A4*1."

    "summary": "This in vitro pharmacogenomics study investigated how 22 CYP3A4 genetic variants found in the Chinese Han population affect the metabolism of ticagrelor, an antiplatelet drug used for acute coronary syndrome. Ticagrelor's adverse effects (bleeding and dyspnea) correlate with its plasma concentration, and CYP3A4 is responsible for 95% of its metabolism. The researchers expressed 22 CYP3A4 variants in insect cells and incubated them with ticagrelor to measure the formation of its active metabolite AR-C124910XX using UHPLC-MS/MS. Key findings showed significant variation in intrinsic clearance (CLint) among variants: CYP3A4*11, *18, and *33 demonstrated higher activity than wild-type; four variants (*10, *23, *32, *34) showed similar activity; 14 variants showed reduced activity (1.48-75.11% of wild-type); and CYP3A4*30 showed no detectable activity. CYP3A4*17 and *24 exhibited severely reduced activity (>90% decrease). These findings have clinical implications for identifying poor metabolizers who may be at increased risk for adverse effects due to elevated ticagrelor concentrations, potentially requiring dose adjustments for safer therapeutic outcomes.",
