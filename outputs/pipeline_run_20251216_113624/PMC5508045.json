    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the contributions of genetic and non-genetic factors to stable warfarin dose variability in 250 Thai patients. The researchers genotyped four SNPs: VKORC1 -1639G>A, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2 rs2108622, and UGT1A1 rs887829 using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Key findings showed that patients with VKORC1 -1639G>A variant genotypes (GA and AA) required significantly lower warfarin doses compared to wild-type (GG), with the AA genotype requiring 49.7% lower doses. Similarly, CYP2C9*3 carriers needed significantly lower doses than wild-type patients. CYP4F2 rs2108622 TT genotype was associated with modestly higher dose requirements (1.2% contribution), while UGT1A1 rs887829 showed no significant association with dose variability. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that genetic factors (VKORC1 -1639G>A, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2 rs2108622) combined with non-genetic factors (age, BMI, antiplatelet drug use, amiodarone use, and current smoking status) explained 51.3% of warfarin dose variability. VKORC1 -1639G>A was the strongest predictor (26.2%), followed by age (10.8%) and CYP2C9*3 (6.0%). The study confirms that both genetic and clinical factors are important for predicting warfarin dose requirements in Thai patients.",
