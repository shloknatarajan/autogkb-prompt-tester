    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated long-term associations between genetic variants in pharmacogenes and clinical outcomes in 79 kidney transplant recipients over a 12-year follow-up period. The researchers analyzed 37 SNPs from 14 genes involved in drug metabolism and transport (ADME mechanisms) in both donors and recipients. Key findings include: (1) Variants in transporter genes ABCB1 and ABCC2 were significantly associated with 12-year survival after false discovery rate correction; (2) Increased tumor risk correlated with ABCC2 variants in donors, while CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT variant in recipients showed decreased risk; (3) Renal function was influenced by variants in ABCB1, ABCC2, CYP3A5, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6; (4) Tacrolimus dose-adjusted concentrations were affected by variants in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C19, ABCB1, and SLCO1B1; (5) CYP2C19 rs4244285 AA variant increased nephrotoxicity risk, while SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AA and AG variants reduced it; (6) Gene-gene interactions between metabolizer and transporter genes were also associated with altered clinical event risks. The study confirms CYP3A5 variants affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and supports pharmacogenetic testing for personalized immunosuppressive therapy management in kidney transplantation, though validation in larger cohorts is needed.",
