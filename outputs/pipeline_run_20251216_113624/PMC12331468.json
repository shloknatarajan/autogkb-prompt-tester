    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated genetic variants associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in 82 Chilean patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. The researchers analyzed 16 genetic variants in genes involved in drug metabolism and transport (TYMS, TYMP, DPYD, GSTP1, MTHFR, ERCC2, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC4, and ABCG2) using a retrospective nested case-control design. Key findings included: the GSTP1 rs1695 G allele was protective against neuropathy (OR=0.147, p=0.012) but increased mucositis risk (OR=2.27, p=0.036); the DPYD rs1801265 C allele was associated with higher neuropathy risk (OR=4.58, p=0.05); the TYMS 3'UTR deletion (rs11280056) protected against hematological ADRs (OR=0.029, p=0.001); and the TYMS 5'UTR 3R genotype (rs45445694) increased risk of skin disorders (OR=6.40, p=0.029). Two multivariate predictive models were developed: one for anemia risk incorporating TYMP rs11479 and ABCB1 rs1045642 (p=0.027, AUC=0.71), and another for pain risk using MTHFR rs1801131 and ERCC2 rs13181 (p=0.01, AUC=0.75). The study provides a foundation for developing pharmacogenetic-based predictive models to improve chemotherapy safety in Chilean colorectal cancer patients through personalized dose adjustments.",
