    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the association between NLRP3 inflammasome gene polymorphisms (CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility, disease severity, and response to TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors (etanercept and infliximab) in 100 Iraqi RA patients and 100 healthy controls.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **Disease susceptibility**: Neither CARD8 rs2043211 nor NLRP3 rs4612666 polymorphisms showed significant association with RA susceptibility when comparing genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls.\n\n2. **Cytokine correlations**: Serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels were significantly elevated in RA patients compared to controls and positively correlated with disease activity (DAS-28 scores). Non-responders to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy had significantly higher cytokine levels.\n\n3. **Genotype-phenotype associations**: The TT genotypes of both CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 were significantly associated with higher DAS-28 scores, elevated TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels, more active disease course, and poorer response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy.\n\n4. **Treatment response**: Variant genotypes (T allele-bearing) of both SNPs were associated with lower response rates to anti-TNF-\u03b1 drugs. The recessive genetic models showed significant associations with higher disease activity and non-response to treatment.\n\n5. **Sex differences**: Males showed better clinical response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy compared to females.\n\nThe study concludes that while these polymorphisms may not predict RA susceptibility, they could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity and response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy in Iraqi RA patients.",
