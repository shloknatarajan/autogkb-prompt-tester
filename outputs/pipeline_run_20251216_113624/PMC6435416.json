    "summary": "This retrospective cohort study investigated the association between CYP2D6 metabolizer status and adverse events (AEs) in pediatric patients treated with risperidone. Using BioVU, a DNA biobank linked to electronic health records at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, researchers identified 257 children (\u226418 years) with at least four weeks of risperidone exposure. Participants underwent CYP2D6 genotyping and were classified as poor (6%), intermediate (7%), normal (85%), or ultrarapid (2%) metabolizers. For analysis, patients were grouped as poor/intermediate metabolizers (n=33, 13%) versus normal/ultrarapid metabolizers (n=224, 87%). The study found that 30% of all children experienced AEs, with weight change (9%), sedation (6%), and extrapyramidal symptoms (6%) being most common. AEs were significantly more frequent in poor/intermediate metabolizers (46%) compared to normal/ultrarapid metabolizers (27%, P=0.04). After multivariate adjustment for age, sex, race, and initial dose, poor/intermediate metabolizers had 2.4-fold increased risk of AEs (95% CI 1.1-5.1, P=0.03). Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors did not significantly affect AE risk in normal/ultrarapid metabolizers. The authors conclude that pre-prescription CYP2D6 genotyping could identify high-risk children who may benefit from alternative therapy, dose reduction, or enhanced monitoring.",
