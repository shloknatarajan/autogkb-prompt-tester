    "summary": "This retrospective pharmacogenomics study investigated risk factors for adverse events in 36 Japanese patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil and L-leucovorin (nal-IRI/FL) therapy. The study focused on UGT1A1 polymorphisms (*6 and *28 variants), which affect the metabolism of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Patients were categorized by UGT1A1 genotype: 16 wild-type (-/-), 16 heterozygous (+/-), and 4 homozygous (+/+). Key findings showed that patients with UGT1A1*6 or *28 homozygous (+/+) genotype had significantly lower nadir counts of white blood cells (p=0.033) and neutrophils (p=0.043) compared to other genotypes. Multiple regression analysis identified three significant risk factors for leukopenia: UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) genotype (p=0.009), elevated pre-treatment AST levels (p=0.019), and pancreatic head cancer location (p=0.030). For neutropenia, only the UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) genotype was significantly associated (p=0.017). No significant risk factors were identified for diarrhea. The study concludes that patients with homozygous UGT1A1 variants require careful monitoring for myelosuppression during nal-IRI/FL treatment, and that liver function and tumor location may also influence toxicity risk.",
