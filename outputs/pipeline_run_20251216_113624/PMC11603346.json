    "summary": "This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association between CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in HIV patients receiving nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), specifically efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP). The authors searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases, identifying 39 publications reporting genetic associations with antiretroviral DILI. The most frequently studied genes were UGT1A1, CYP2B6, ABCB1, HLA-Cw, and HLA-DRB1. Protein-protein interaction analysis identified CYP2B6 as a central node in the network. For the meta-analysis, three studies (795 patients) examined EFV-induced liver injury and two studies (820 patients) examined NVP-induced liver injury. Results showed that CYP2B6*6 carriers (poor metabolizers) had significantly increased risk of EFV-induced liver injury compared to normal metabolizers (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.24-3.01 for combined heterozygous and homozygous carriers). Conversely, CYP2B6*6 carriers showed reduced susceptibility to NVP-induced liver injury (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.84). The contrasting results between EFV and NVP may be explained by differences in metabolic pathways and toxic metabolite formation. The authors note limitations including small sample sizes and limited ethnic diversity (primarily African populations). This is the first meta-analysis examining CYP2B6 polymorphisms and ARVDILI, providing foundational knowledge for personalized medicine approaches in HIV treatment.",
