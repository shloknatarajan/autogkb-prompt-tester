    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the associations between SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms (388A>G and 521T>C) and hepatic function, baseline lipid levels, and lipid-lowering response to simvastatin in 542 Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia. The SLCO1B1 gene encodes OATP1B1, a hepatic transporter important for statin uptake and bile acid transport. Key findings include: (1) Patients with the 388AA genotype had significantly higher ALT and AST levels compared to those with 388AG or 388GG genotypes, suggesting an association with hepatic function markers; (2) The combination of 388AA and 521TT genotypes was associated with the highest ALT and AST levels; (3) Haplotype analysis showed that patients with abnormal liver enzyme levels had higher frequency of the 388A/521T haplotype and lower frequency of the 388G/521T haplotype; (4) Patients with the 388AA genotype had higher baseline HDL-C levels; (5) Carriers of the 388G allele with 521TT genotype showed greater TC and LDL-C reduction after 4 weeks of simvastatin treatment compared to 521C allele carriers; (6) No significant associations were found between SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and statin-induced creatine kinase elevations. The authors conclude that SLCO1B1 polymorphism interactions may be important genetic determinants of hepatic function and simvastatin therapeutic efficacy in Chinese hyperlipidemia patients.",
