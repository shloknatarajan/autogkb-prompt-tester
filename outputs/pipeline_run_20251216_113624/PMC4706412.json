    "summary": "This study developed a novel admixture-adjusted pharmacogenetic algorithm to refine warfarin dosing in Caribbean Hispanic patients. Using a derivation cohort of 255 patients from the Veterans Affairs Caribbean Healthcare System in Puerto Rico, researchers performed multiple linear regression analysis incorporating genotypes (CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2, NQO1), admixture metrics, and clinical/demographic factors. The resulting algorithm explained 70% of warfarin dose variability (MAE=0.72mg/day), outperforming a clinical non-genetic algorithm (R\u00b2=0.60, MAE=0.99mg/day) and two prior pharmacogenetic algorithms (IWPC and Lenzini models). For high-risk patients requiring low (\u22643mg/day) or high (\u22657mg/day) doses, 54.5% of predictions using the new model achieved ideal dosing compared to only 29% with the clinical algorithm. External validation in 55 independent patients confirmed the model's predictability (R\u00b2=58%, MAE=0.89mg/day). The study identified ethnic-specific variants including CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, and *11 alleles typically found in African ancestry populations, highlighting the genetic diversity in this admixed population. Results support incorporating individual genotypes and admixture metrics into pharmacogenetic models for admixed populations like Caribbean Hispanics to improve warfarin dosing accuracy.",
