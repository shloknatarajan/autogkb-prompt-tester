    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the multiple HLA allele associations with cutaneous nevirapine (NVP) hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) in HIV-1 infected patients by examining similarities in peptide binding specificities and binding pocket structures of HLA molecules. The researchers analyzed 151 cases and 413 controls across Asian, African, and Caucasian ancestral groups using high-resolution HLA typing. Key findings include: (1) Primary predisposition to cutaneous NVP HSR is attributed to a cluster of HLA-C alleles (HLA-C*04:01, -C*05:01, -C*18:01) sharing a common F pocket structure, with HLA-C*04:01 showing consistent risk across all ethnic groups (OR=3.06, P=0.0001); (2) An independent secondary association was found with HLA-DRB1 class II alleles sharing a common P4 pocket (HLA-DRB1*01:01/02/03 and -DRB1*04:04/05/08/10); (3) Protection against NVP HSR was conferred by a cluster of HLA-B alleles (HLA-B*15:01/12/24/25/27/32/35 and -B*52:01) characterized by a specific B pocket structure. Molecular docking studies suggested NVP preferentially binds to the F pocket of HLA-C*04:01. The study demonstrates that drug-specific interactions within the HLA antigen binding cleft can be shared across HLA molecules with similar binding pockets, providing a mechanistic explanation for the multiple HLA associations observed in cutaneous NVP HSR and identifying novel risk and protective alleles.",
