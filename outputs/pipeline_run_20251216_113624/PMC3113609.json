    "summary": "This study investigated genetic markers for carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in European populations. While HLA-B*1502 is strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN) in Asian populations, it does not predict these reactions in Europeans. The researchers conducted a genome-wide association study using samples from 22 subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, 43 subjects with maculopapular exanthema, and 3,987 controls of European descent. They identified HLA-A*3101 (prevalence 2-5% in Northern Europeans) as significantly associated with hypersensitivity syndrome (P=3.5\u00d710\u207b\u2078). Replication in 145 additional subjects confirmed HLA-A*3101 as a risk factor for hypersensitivity syndrome (OR=12.41), maculopapular exanthema (OR=8.33), and SJS-TEN (OR=25.93). The presence of HLA-A*3101 increased hypersensitivity risk from 5.0% to 26.0%, while its absence reduced risk to 3.8%. The authors calculated that 83 patients would need screening to prevent one hypersensitivity case. This finding parallels HLA-B*5701 screening for abacavir hypersensitivity and suggests HLA-A*3101 testing could be clinically useful for carbamazepine prescribing in European populations.",
