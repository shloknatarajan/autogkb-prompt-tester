    "summary": "This study investigated the contribution of rare genetic variants in the DPYD gene to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, which can cause severe toxicity in patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Using next-generation sequencing, researchers analyzed DPYD in 2,972 patients who were phenotyped for DPD activity using the dihydrouracil/uracil plasma ratio. Of these patients, 19.7% showed partial DPD deficiency. The study identified 30 distinct genetic variants in DPD-deficient patients, with 77% being rare (MAF <1%) and 58% of these predicted to be deleterious. The three clinically relevant rare variants (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T) showed strong associations with low DPD activity. Importantly, rare variants with MAF <1% were significantly enriched in patients with partial DPD deficiency (9.3% vs 3.2%, p<0.00001). When excluding known clinically relevant variants and focusing on those with CADD scores >15, rare deleterious variants remained more common in DPD-deficient patients (4.2% vs 1.6%, p<0.001). The findings demonstrate that rare DPYD variants account for a significant portion of interindividual DPD activity variability, suggesting that comprehensive NGS-based genotyping rather than targeted SNP testing should be considered for guiding personalized fluoropyrimidine therapy to prevent severe toxicity.",
