    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated genetic risk factors for hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. The researchers conducted the first HLA allele and genome-wide association study (GWAS) specifically for pegaspargase hypersensitivity in racially diverse cohorts totaling 4,259 patients from three protocols (TXVI, AALL0232, and AALL0434). In patients of European ancestry (EA), the HLA haplotype DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02 showed the strongest association with pegaspargase hypersensitivity, with HLA-DQB1*02:02 being the most significant allele (P=3.8\u00d710\u207b\u2079, OR=2.14). This is notably the same haplotype previously associated with native (non-PEGylated) asparaginase reactions, despite different antigenic targets between the preparations. All genome-wide significant SNPs in EA patients mapped to class II HLA loci. In non-European ancestry patients, the rs9958628 variant in ARHGAP28 (a gene previously linked to immune response in children) showed the strongest genetic association (P=8.9\u00d710\u207b\u2079). The study also identified non-genetic risk factors including fewer intrathecal injections during induction (TXVI) and male sex (AALL0232). These findings demonstrate ancestry-specific differences in genetic predisposition to pegaspargase allergy and implicate both HLA loci and ARHGAP28 in hypersensitivity mechanisms.",
