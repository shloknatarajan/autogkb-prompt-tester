    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the effects of genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters on steady-state plasma concentrations of simvastatin in 89 Thai patients with dyslipidemia or coronary artery disease. Researchers analyzed 10 SNPs across seven genes (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) using the MassARRAY System and measured simvastatin lactone (SVL) and simvastatin acid (SVA) concentrations via UHPLC-MS/MS. The key finding was that patients carrying the SLCO1B1 c.521TC+CC genotype had significantly higher SVA levels compared to those with c.521TT (0.53 vs. 0.19 ng/mL, p=0.03). Similarly, the SLCO1B1*1b/*15 diplotype was associated with elevated SVA concentrations compared to *1a/*1a (0.58 vs. 0.16 ng/mL, p<0.001). No significant associations were found between other pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms and simvastatin concentrations. The study confirms that SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (c.521T>C), either alone or combined with rs2306283 (c.388A>G), reduces OATP1B1 transporter function, leading to elevated simvastatin acid levels and potentially increased myotoxicity risk. These findings support the clinical utility of SLCO1B1 genotyping to guide statin therapy in Thai patients, consistent with CPIC guidelines.",
