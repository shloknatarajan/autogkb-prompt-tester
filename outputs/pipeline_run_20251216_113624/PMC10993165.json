    "summary": "This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)/cotrimoxazole (CTX)-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). The authors searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases and included 6 case-control studies involving 322 patients with SCARs (236 with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [SJS/TEN] and 86 with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS]), along with 8,448 healthy controls and 229 tolerant controls. Populations studied included European, Japanese, Malaysian, Taiwanese, and Thai individuals.\n\nKey findings showed significant associations between SMX/CTX-induced SCARs and multiple HLA alleles when compared to tolerant controls: HLA-A*11:01 (OR 2.10), HLA-B*13:01 (OR 5.96), HLA-B*15:02 (OR 2.23), HLA-B*38:02 (OR 3.47), and HLA-C*08:01 (OR 2.63). Phenotype-specific associations were identified: HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*38:02 were associated with SJS/TEN, while HLA-A*68:01 and HLA-B*39:01 were associated with DRESS. HLA-B*13:01 showed associations with both SJS/TEN and DRESS. Geographic variation was observed, with HLA-B*13:01 showing associations across Malaysian, Taiwanese, and Thai populations, while HLA-B*38:01 and HLA-B*38:02 were associated with SCARs in European populations. These findings suggest multiple genetic factors contribute to SMX/CTX-induced SCARs pathogenesis.",
