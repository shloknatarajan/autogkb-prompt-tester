    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated the effects of CYP2B6 G516T polymorphisms on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations in 124 HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults receiving rifampicin-based TB therapy. Patients received either efavirenz (600 mg/day, n=65) or nevirapine (400 mg/day, n=59) based antiretroviral therapy. The CYP2B6-516TT genotype frequency was 13.85% in the efavirenz group and 3.39% in the nevirapine group. Key findings showed that patients with the TT genotype had significantly higher 12-hour post-dose plasma efavirenz concentrations at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation compared to GT or GG genotypes (p<0.0001). Similar trends were observed for nevirapine, though less pronounced due to small TT sample size. Importantly, rifampicin co-administration had only small effects on plasma drug levels compared to the substantial impact of the CYP2B6-516TT genotype. Patients with TT genotype showed a trend toward higher viral suppression rates at week 12. The study also examined CYP3A4 polymorphisms but found limited variation in the Thai population. The authors conclude that CYP2B6-516TT genotype significantly impacts plasma NNRTI concentrations, which may be useful for optimizing HIV/TB treatment.",
