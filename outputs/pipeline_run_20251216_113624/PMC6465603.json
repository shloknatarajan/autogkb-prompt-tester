    "summary": "This retrospective study investigated the association between NUDT15 R139C (rs116855232) and TPMT*3C (rs1142345) polymorphisms and azathioprine (AZA)-induced leukopenia in 149 Chinese patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and related cirrhosis. Twelve patients (8.1%) developed leukopenia during AZA treatment. The NUDT15 rs116855232 T risk allele was strongly associated with leukopenia (OR=20.41, P<0.00001), with 91.67% sensitivity and 89.05% specificity. Leukopenia occurred in 37.5% of CT heterozygotes and 100% of TT homozygotes, compared to only 0.8% of CC wild-type patients. Patients with CT genotype had significantly higher 6-TGN concentrations and required lower maintenance doses (0.96 vs 1.23 mg/kg/day, P=0.028) compared to CC genotype patients. In contrast, TPMT*3C showed no significant association with leukopenia, likely due to its low frequency (1.7%) in this population. Notably, 13 patients with pre-existing leukopenia (likely due to cirrhosis/hypersplenism) did not experience progressive leukopenia on AZA if they had wild-type NUDT15. The study concludes that NUDT15 genotyping should be performed before AZA therapy in AIH patients, with dose adjustments recommended for heterozygous carriers.",
