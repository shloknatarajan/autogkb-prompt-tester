    "summary": "This retrospective study investigated the safety and efficacy of individualized irinotecan dosing based on pre-treatment UGT1A1*6 genotyping in 110 advanced gastric cancer patients receiving second-line chemotherapy. Irinotecan doses were adjusted according to UGT1A1*6 polymorphism: 125 mg/m\u00b2 for GG (wild-type), 100 mg/m\u00b2 for GA (heterozygous), and 75 mg/m\u00b2 for AA (homozygous mutant) genotypes. The genotype frequencies were 60.9% GG, 31.8% GA, and 7.3% AA for UGT1A1*6, and 70.9% TA6/TA6, 25.5% TA6/TA7, and 3.6% TA7/TA7 for UGT1A1*28. Results showed no significant differences in progression-free survival (4.8 vs 4.9 vs 4.4 months) or overall survival (9.3 vs 9.3 vs NA months) among UGT1A1*6 genotype groups after dose adjustment. However, UGT1A1*6 polymorphism was significantly associated with delayed diarrhea (p=0.000), leukopenia (p=0.003), and neutropenia (p=0.000), while UGT1A1*28 showed no significant association with these toxicities. Patients with AA genotype experienced 100% grade 3/4 toxicity rates for diarrhea, leukopenia, and neutropenia despite dose reduction, leading 5 of 8 AA patients to switch to paclitaxel. The study concludes that genotype-guided irinotecan dosing shows encouraging outcomes for GG/GA patients, but irinotecan may not be suitable for AA genotype patients in East Asian populations.",
