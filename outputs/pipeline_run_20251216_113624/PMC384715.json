    "summary": "This pharmacogenomics study investigated genetic predictors of abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome in HIV patients. The researchers conducted fine recombinant genetic mapping in 248 abacavir-exposed individuals from the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, identifying 18 definite hypersensitivity cases (7.3%) and 230 tolerant controls. The study confirmed that HLA-B*5701 was present in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases versus 1.7% of controls (OR=960, P<0.00001). Through haplotype mapping within the 57.1 ancestral haplotype, researchers identified a susceptibility locus within the 14-kb Hsp70 gene cluster. A nonsynonymous polymorphism in Hsp70-Hom (M493T) combined with HLA-B*5701 was found in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases but only 0.4% of controls (OR=3,893, P<0.00001). Functional studies showed that abacavir-hypersensitive individuals demonstrated increased monocyte TNF expression in response to ex vivo abacavir stimulation, which was abrogated with CD8+ T cell depletion. The authors propose that both HLA-B*5701 and Hsp70-Hom M493T alleles are necessary for abacavir hypersensitivity development, likely mediated by an HLA-B*5701-restricted immune response. These findings suggest prospective genetic testing could reduce hypersensitivity prevalence from 8% to 0.4% and have significant clinical implications for managing abacavir-exposed HIV patients.",
