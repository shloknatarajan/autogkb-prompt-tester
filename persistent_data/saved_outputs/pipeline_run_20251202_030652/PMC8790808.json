    "summary": "Study aim and design:\nThis pharmacogenomic study investigated germline genetic risk factors\u2014both HLA and non\u2011HLA\u2014for hypersensitivity reactions specifically to PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (pegaspargase) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Unlike prior work that mixed native and PEGylated asparaginase, this analysis was restricted to protocols using pegaspargase as first\u2011line therapy and included racially/ancestrally diverse cohorts.\n\nCohorts and phenotype:\n\u2022 St. Jude Total XVI (TXVI, n=598)\n\u2022 COG AALL0232 (B\u2011ALL, n=2472)\n\u2022 COG AALL0434 (T\u2011ALL, n=1189)\n\nAll patients received upfront pegaspargase; hypersensitivity was defined as CTCAE grade \u22652. Reaction rates were 13.7% (TXVI), 15.2% (AALL0232), and 8.2% (AALL0434). Clinical covariates associated with risk included:\n\u2022 More intrathecal doses during induction \u2192 lower risk (TXVI; OR\u22480.73, P\u22486\u00d710\u207b\u2075)\n\u2022 Male sex \u2192 higher risk (AALL0232; OR\u22481.24, P=0.025)\nNo consistent ancestry effect on reaction rates was seen.\n\nGenotyping and analysis:\nGermline DNA was genotyped using Illumina or Affymetrix arrays; untyped SNPs were imputed, and HLA alleles were imputed with SNP2HLA (all cohorts) or inferred from WES using BWAkit (TXVI). Patients were stratified into ancestry groups (EA, AA, AMR, East/South Asian, Other) using genome\u2011wide data. GWAS and HLA association analyses were performed within each cohort, adjusted for ancestry and protocol\u2011specific covariates, then combined by meta\u2011analysis. Genome\u2011wide significance thresholds were: 5\u00d710\u207b\u2078 for SNPs; 5.2\u00d710\u207b\u2074 for HLA alleles; 4.8\u00d710\u207b\u2075 for HLA amino acid variants.\n\nKey HLA findings in European\u2011ancestry (EA) patients:\nIn EA patients (n=2168), a strong and consistent association was found between pegaspargase hypersensitivity and a class II HLA haplotype:\n\u2022 HLA\u2011DQB1*02:02 (top hit)\n  \u2013 P_meta = 3.8\u00d710\u207b\u2079, OR\u22482.1\n  \u2013 Significant in all three protocols\n\u2022 HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\n  \u2013 P_meta = 2.2\u00d710\u207b\u2075, OR\u22482.0\n\u2022 HLA\u2011DQA1*02:01\n  \u2013 P_meta = 2.7\u00d710\u207b\u2075, OR\u22482.0\n\nPhasing showed these three alleles constitute a common extended haplotype DRB1*07:01\u2013DQA1*02:01\u2013DQB1*02:02 in EAs. Nearly all DQB1*02:02 carriers also harbored the full haplotype.\n\nAt the amino\u2011acid level, glycine at position 135 of HLA\u2011DQB1 (which marks DQB1*02:02) was the top association (P_meta = 3.8\u00d710\u207b\u2079, OR\u22482.1), reinforcing DQB1 as the primary signal. In conditional models, the three alleles could not be distinguished statistically due to strong linkage disequilibrium, but several lines of evidence (top P values, amino\u2011acid marker) support DQB1*02:02 as the key driver, with DRB1*07:01 conferring high risk primarily when co\u2011inherited with DQB1*02:02.\n\nImportantly, this is the same HLA class II haplotype previously associated with hypersensitivity to native E. coli asparaginase (ASNase), indicating a shared immunogenetic predisposition despite different dominant antibody targets (PEG versus asparaginase protein).\n\nGenome\u2011wide SNP associations in EAs:\nIn EA\u2011restricted GWAS, all genome\u2011wide significant SNPs mapped to the HLA class II region:\n\u2022 Top SNP: rs1694129 (5\u2032 of HLA\u2011DQB1)\n  \u2013 P_meta = 1.1\u00d710\u207b\u2078, OR\u22482.0\n  \u2013 Strong LD with HLA\u2011DQB1*02:02 in EAs (r\u00b2=0.96)\nAfter adjusting for HLA\u2011DQB1*02:02 or DRB1*07:01, no SNP remained genome\u2011wide significant, indicating that the EA signal is largely captured by this HLA haplotype.\n\nHLA and SNP associations in non\u2011European ancestries:\nDirect HLA calls from WES in non\u2011EA TXVI patients did not show significant replication of the high\u2011risk EA alleles, likely reflecting smaller sample size and differing LD patterns. When HLA was imputed (with acknowledged lower accuracy), DRB1*07:01, DQA1*02:01, and DQB1*02:02 showed nominal associations in non\u2011EAs (P_meta\u22480.01\u20130.04, OR\u22481.8\u20132.1), suggesting some shared risk but with reduced effect or tagging.\n\nUsing SNP\u2011based GWAS in non\u2011EAs (n=1607), distinct non\u2011HLA signals emerged:\n\u2022 ARHGAP28 locus (5\u2032 UTR variant rs9958628)\n  \u2013 Non\u2011EA meta\u2011analysis: P_meta = 8.9\u00d710\u207b\u2079, OR\u22483.7 (genome\u2011wide significant)\n  \u2013 All\u2011ancestry meta\u2011analysis: top non\u2011HLA signal (P_meta = 1.2\u00d710\u207b\u2077, OR\u22483.0)\n  \u2013 Strongest in African\u2011ancestry (AA) patients; not significant in EAs/AMRs (likely very low MAF in those groups)\n\u2022 GPBP1 downstream variants (rs79377225, rs11739459)\n  \u2013 Non\u2011EA meta\u2011analysis: P\u22482.5\u00d710\u207b\u2078 and 2.7\u00d710\u207b\u2078 (OR\u22482.5\u20132.7)\n  \u2013 Retained genome\u2011wide significance in trans\u2011ancestry meta\u2011analysis.\n\nSome HLA\u2011DRA region SNPs also associated with risk in non\u2011EAs (esp. AMR) at sub\u2013genome\u2011wide levels, but there was considerable ancestry\u2011specific variation in the exact HLA variants. Overall, HLA class II SNPs contributed less strongly in AAs than in EAs, and HLA tagging patterns differed by ancestry.\n\nFunctional and mechanistic context:\n\u2022 The repeated identification of DRB1*07:01\u2013DQA1*02:01\u2013DQB1*02:02 across independent cohorts and different asparaginase formulations suggests these HLA molecules present asparaginase\u2011 or PEG\u2011related antigens (or complexes) that drive T\u2011cell\u2013dependent IgE/IgG responses.\n\u2022 ARHGAP28 encodes a Rho GTPase\u2011activating protein. Variants in this locus have previously been associated with poor response to inhaled corticosteroids in asthma, particularly in non\u2011EA children, pointing to a broader role in immune/inflammatory regulation.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics:\n\u2022 In EA pediatric ALL patients, carriage of the DRB1*07:01\u2013DQA1*02:01\u2013DQB1*02:02 haplotype roughly doubles risk of clinically significant pegaspargase hypersensitivity (grade \u22652). This same haplotype also predicts hypersensitivity to native ASNase, so these alleles can be considered shared pharmacogenetic risk markers for the entire E. coli asparaginase/pegaspargase class.\n\u2022 Tagging SNPs such as rs1694129 (near HLA\u2011DQB1) or the previously reported rs28383172/rs7775228 pair can serve as surrogates for this haplotype in EAs, which may be useful in settings without high\u2011resolution HLA typing.\n\u2022 In non\u2011EA patients, strong non\u2011HLA susceptibility at ARHGAP28 and GPBP1 highlights that genetic architecture of pegaspargase allergy is ancestry\u2011specific. HLA associations observed in EAs only partly extend into non\u2011EA groups, and imputation accuracy is more limited.\n\u2022 These data support future development of ancestry\u2011informed pharmacogenomic risk models for pegaspargase hypersensitivity. Clinically, such models could be used to:\n  \u2013 Identify high\u2011risk patients for closer monitoring, altered asparaginase schedule, or early switch to Erwinia\u2011derived products.\n  \u2013 Guide mechanistic studies into PEG\u2011 or protein\u2011specific T\u2011cell epitopes and into ARHGAP28\u2011mediated immune pathways.\n\nLimitations:\n\u2022 No fully independent replication cohort; conclusions rely on meta\u2011analysis across three protocols.\n\u2022 HLA imputation in non\u2011EAs is less accurate and sample sizes in non\u2011EA strata (especially AA) are modest, limiting power and precision.\n\u2022 Treatment differences across protocols (IT therapy, glucocorticoids, nelarabine, methotrexate regimens) could confound comparability of reaction rates.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nPegaspargase hypersensitivity in pediatric ALL is strongly associated, in European\u2011ancestry patients, with the HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\u2013DQA1*02:01\u2013DQB1*02:02 haplotype previously linked to native asparaginase allergy, indicating a shared class II HLA\u2011restricted immune mechanism. In non\u2011European ancestries, additional genome\u2011wide significant risk loci at ARHGAP28 (and near GPBP1) point to distinct, ancestry\u2011specific non\u2011HLA contributions. These findings refine the pharmacogenomic landscape of asparaginase/pegaspargase hypersensitivity and motivate ancestry\u2011tailored genetic risk prediction and mechanistic follow\u2011up studies.\n",
