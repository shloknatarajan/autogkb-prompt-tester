    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis single-center retrospective study evaluated whether pre-treatment UGT1A1*6 genotyping can safely individualize irinotecan dosing as second-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer, and whether genotype-guided dosing affects efficacy.\n\nPatients and genotyping:\n- 110 Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) received second-line chemotherapy after fluoropyrimidine + platinum regimens.\n- UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 were genotyped before treatment.\n- Genotype distribution:\n  - UGT1A1*6: GG (wild-type) 60.9%, GA 31.8%, AA 7.3%.\n  - UGT1A1*28: TA6/TA6 70.9%, TA6/TA7 25.5%, TA7/TA7 3.6%.\n\nGenotype-guided regimen:\n- Irinotecan q3w, given on days 1 and 8 of each cycle, with dose based on UGT1A1*6:\n  - GG: 125 mg/m\u00b2 (full dose).\n  - GA: 100 mg/m\u00b2 (~20% reduction).\n  - AA: 75 mg/m\u00b2 (~40% reduction), or early switch to paclitaxel if severe toxicity; 3 AA patients were started directly on paclitaxel 125 mg/m\u00b2.\n- Total: 107 patients received irinotecan; 3 AA patients received only paclitaxel.\n\nEfficacy outcomes:\n- Median follow-up: 9.0 months.\n- For the whole cohort:\n  - Median PFS: 4.4 months.\n  - Median OS: 8.7 months.\n- PFS by UGT1A1*6:\n  - GG: 4.8 months (95% CI 4.1\u20135.5).\n  - GA: 4.9 months (95% CI 4.4\u20135.3).\n  - AA: 4.4 months (95% CI 3.9\u2013NA).\n- OS by UGT1A1*6:\n  - GG: 9.3 months (95% CI 8.8\u201310.9).\n  - GA: 9.3 months (95% CI 8.7\u2013NA).\n  - AA: not reached (95% CI 8.8\u2013NA), though number of AA patients was very small and many switched to paclitaxel.\n- PFS and OS by UGT1A1*28 (TA6/6 vs TA6/7 vs TA7/7) were similar; no significant differences.\n- Combined allele analyses (single vs double variant alleles across *6 and *28) also showed no significant efficacy differences.\n- Univariable and multivariate Cox analyses:\n  - UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 were not associated with PFS or OS.\n  - Independent prognostic factors for OS were diffuse-type Lauren classification (worse prognosis) and having had prior surgery (better prognosis).\n\nToxicity outcomes and pharmacogenetic signal:\n- UGT1A1*28:\n  - No significant association with diarrhea, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia (all p > 0.1).\n- UGT1A1*6:\n  - Significant association with key irinotecan toxicities despite genotype-based dose adjustment:\n    - Delayed diarrhea: p = 0.000.\n    - Leukopenia: p = 0.003.\n    - Neutropenia: p = 0.000.\n  - Toxicities increased stepwise from GG \u2192 GA \u2192 AA.\n- Grade 3\u20134 toxicity rates by UGT1A1*6 (from Table 3 and text):\n  - Diarrhea:\n    - GG: 2%.\n    - GA: 23%.\n    - AA: 100%.\n  - Leukopenia:\n    - GG: 19%.\n    - GA: 31%.\n    - AA: 100%.\n  - Neutropenia:\n    - GG: 24%.\n    - GA: 31%.\n    - AA: 100%.\n- Even with a 40% irinotecan dose reduction, all AA patients who received irinotecan experienced severe hematologic and/or gastrointestinal toxicity; in 5 of 8 AA patients, treatment had to be switched to paclitaxel. Three additional AA patients were placed on paclitaxel alone up front due to anticipated risk.\n- Thrombocytopenia and anemia were not significantly linked to either *6 or *28 genotype.\n\nInterpretation and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- In this East Asian cohort, UGT1A1*6\u2014rather than *28\u2014was the key determinant of irinotecan-related delayed diarrhea and myelosuppression.\n- Dose-reduced irinotecan in GA carriers achieved PFS and OS comparable to full-dose irinotecan in GG patients, but GA patients still had more toxicity than GG despite the 20% reduction.\n- Homozygous UGT1A1*6 (AA) patients had excessive severe toxicity even at 40% dose reduction; most required switching to paclitaxel, but their survival was not obviously inferior after that switch (though numbers are very small and estimates unstable).\n- Overall, genotype-guided irinotecan dosing by UGT1A1*6 allowed:\n  - Maintenance of similar survival across *6 genotypes when AA patients were promptly switched to paclitaxel.\n  - Marked differentiation of toxicity risk, highlighting AA as a very high-risk group for irinotecan.\n\nClinical take-home points for pharmacogenomics:\n- Pre-treatment UGT1A1*6 testing is clinically useful in Chinese/East Asian gastric cancer patients being considered for irinotecan:\n  - GG: full-dose irinotecan is reasonable; toxicity profile acceptable.\n  - GA: use dose-reduced irinotecan with careful monitoring; toxicity still higher than GG.\n  - AA: irinotecan is likely unsuitable even at substantially reduced dose; consider alternative agents such as paclitaxel instead of irinotecan.\n- UGT1A1*28 testing adds little for toxicity prediction in this East Asian setting, consistent with prior data that *6 is the dominant functional variant for irinotecan in Asians.\n- The study supports moving toward UGT1A1*6-guided personalization of irinotecan but underscores the need for larger, ideally prospective, trials and better dosing strategies for GA patients, who remain at elevated risk despite preemptive dose reduction.\n\nLimitations:\n- Retrospective, single-center, small sample size\u2014especially very few AA patients.\n- No non-genotyped control arm and no pure paclitaxel control group.\n- Patients with AA genotype were partially or entirely switched to paclitaxel, confounding direct comparisons of efficacy between genotypes under irinotecan.\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- Individualized irinotecan dosing guided by UGT1A1*6 is feasible and appears to balance efficacy and tolerability for non-AA patients with advanced gastric cancer.\n- UGT1A1*6 AA homozygotes experience prohibitive toxicity despite dose reduction and are poor candidates for irinotecan; paclitaxel is a more appropriate second-line choice in this genotype group.\n\npmid: 38497131\npmcid: PMC10946077\n\ntitle: Individual Irinotecan Therapy Under the Guidance of Pre-Treated UGT1A1*6 Genotyping in Gastric Cancer",
