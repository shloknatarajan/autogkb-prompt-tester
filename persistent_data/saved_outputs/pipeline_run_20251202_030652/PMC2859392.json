    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis prospective pharmacogenetic analysis nested in the N2R randomized trial examined whether CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 polymorphisms affect efavirenz and nevirapine plasma concentrations in Thai adults with HIV/TB co\u2011infection receiving rifampicin-containing TB therapy. One hundred twenty\u2011four antiretroviral\u2011na\u00efve patients on rifampicin for 4\u20136 weeks were started on standard-dose ART: efavirenz 600 mg once daily (n=65) or nevirapine 200 mg twice daily (after a 2\u2011week 200 mg once-daily lead\u2011in; n=59) plus lamivudine/stavudine. Patients had plasma NNRTI concentrations measured 12 hours post\u2011dose (C12) at week 6, week 12, and 1 month after stopping rifampicin. Seven SNPs were genotyped (CYP2B6: 516G>T, 777C>A, 415A>G, 1459C>T; CYP3A4: 566T>C, 878T>C, 1088C>T). Clinical outcomes (CD4, HIV\u20111 RNA) were followed up to 48 weeks.\n\nKey genotype frequencies:\n- CYP2B6 516G>T in efavirenz group (n=65): GG 38.5%, GT 47.7%, TT 13.9%.\n- CYP2B6 516G>T in nevirapine group (n=59): GG 44.1%, GT 52.5%, TT 3.4%.\n- Other CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 SNPs showed little or no variation; only CYP2B6 516G>T and CYP3A4 878T>C could be meaningfully evaluated, and CYP3A4 data were limited by very few variant carriers.\n\nMain pharmacokinetic findings (CYP2B6 516G>T):\n1. Efavirenz (strong effect, consistent over time)\n- Mean C12 (mg/L) at week 6 / week 12 / 1 month post\u2011rifampicin:\n  \u2022 TT: 10.97 \u00b1 2.32 / 13.62 \u00b1 4.21 / 8.48 \u00b1 1.30\n  \u2022 GT: 3.43 \u00b1 0.29 / 3.35 \u00b1 0.27 / 3.21 \u00b1 0.22\n  \u2022 GG: 2.88 \u00b1 0.33 / 2.45 \u00b1 0.26 / 2.08 \u00b1 0.16\n- TT carriers had ~3\u20135\u2011fold higher efavirenz concentrations than GG/GT at all time points (p<0.0001 versus either genotype).\n- Despite concomitant rifampicin\u2014a strong CYP inducer\u2014CYP2B6 516TT clearly identified poor metabolizers with markedly elevated efavirenz levels.\n\n2. Nevirapine (similar direction, weaker statistical support)\n- Mean C12 (mg/L) at week 6 / week 12 / 1 month post\u2011rifampicin:\n  \u2022 TT: 14.09 \u00b1 9.49 / 7.94 \u00b1 2.76 / 9.44 \u00b1 0.17\n  \u2022 GT: 5.65 \u00b1 0.54 / 5.58 \u00b1 0.48 / 7.03 \u00b1 0.64\n  \u2022 GG: 5.42 \u00b1 0.48 / 5.34 \u00b1 0.50 / 6.43 \u00b1 0.64\n- Trend toward higher nevirapine levels in TT carriers: significant at week 6 (p=0.003), not significant at week 12 (p=0.409) or 1 month post\u2011rifampicin (p=0.448), likely due to the very small number of TT subjects (n=2 in nevirapine arm).\n\nEffect of rifampicin versus genetics:\n- When not stratified by genotype, for the entire efavirenz group:\n  \u2022 Mean C12 decreased after rifampicin discontinuation: 4.26 mg/L (week 6) \u2192 3.5 mg/L (1 month post\u2011rifampicin); p=0.043 for week 6 vs post\u2011TB.\n- For nevirapine:\n  \u2022 Mean C12 increased after rifampicin discontinuation: 5.83 mg/L (week 6) \u2192 6.84 mg/L (1 month post\u2011rifampicin); p=0.034 (week 6 vs post\u2011TB), p<0.001 (week 12 vs post\u2011TB).\n- Nonetheless, the authors conclude that the magnitude of rifampicin\u2019s effect on efavirenz and nevirapine exposure was much smaller than the impact of CYP2B6 516TT; rifampicin did not \u201cnormalize\u201d the poor metabolizer phenotype.\n\nTherapeutic range and safety implications:\n- All genotype groups maintained efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations above conventional minimum target thresholds (efavirenz \u22651 mg/L; nevirapine \u22653.4 mg/L) even during rifampicin co\u2011therapy.\n- TT carriers had substantially higher efavirenz and likely higher nevirapine levels, raising theoretical concern for toxicity (e.g., CNS effects, rash, hepatotoxicity). In this study, TT patients generally tolerated therapy, but seven participants overall left the parent trial due to adverse events; genotypes of those individuals were not evaluated here.\n\nCYP3A4 878T>C:\n- Very few heterozygous carriers (3 efavirenz, 1 nevirapine). These individuals tended to have higher efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations than TT homozygotes, but numbers were too small for statistical analysis, so no firm conclusion on CYP3A4\u2019s effect was possible.\n\nVirologic and immunologic outcomes:\n- CD4+ T\u2011cell counts: increased robustly and similarly across CYP2B6 genotypes through 48 weeks in both efavirenz and nevirapine arms; no significant genotype effect on CD4 recovery.\n- Viral load suppression (HIV\u20111 RNA <50 copies/mL at week 12):\n  \u2022 Efavirenz: GG 68% (17/25), GT 77.4% (24/31), TT 88.9% (8/9); p=0.430.\n  \u2022 Nevirapine: GG 60% (15/26), GT 71.0% (23/31), TT 100% (2/2); p=0.288.\n- There was a non\u2011significant trend toward higher early suppression rates in TT carriers, consistent with higher drug exposure, but by weeks 24\u201348 almost all patients achieved undetectable viral loads regardless of genotype.\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- CYP2B6 516G>T is a major determinant of efavirenz exposure and a relevant determinant of nevirapine exposure in Thai HIV/TB patients, even in the presence of potent CYP induction by rifampicin.\n- Standard efavirenz 600 mg/day and nevirapine 400 mg/day appear sufficient to maintain therapeutic levels during rifampicin co\u2011treatment across genotypes in this population.\n- CYP2B6 516TT identifies individuals at risk for very high efavirenz (and possibly nevirapine) levels; in other settings, genotype\u2011guided dose reduction has been shown to reduce CNS toxicity. The study supports considering CYP2B6 genotyping when possible for optimizing efavirenz (and perhaps nevirapine) dosing, especially in populations with higher TT frequency.\n- Rifampicin modestly lowers efavirenz and modestly lowers then raises nevirapine concentrations after discontinuation, but its effect is smaller than genetic variability at CYP2B6 516.\n\nLimitations:\n- Single mid\u2011dose (C12) sampling; full pharmacokinetic profiles (AUC, Cmax, clearance) were not obtained.\n- Small sample size of CYP2B6 516TT (especially in the nevirapine arm) and of CYP3A4 variant carriers limits power for some comparisons.\n- Adverse event data were not linked to genotype, so tolerability of high concentrations in TT carriers cannot be fully assessed.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nIn rifampicin\u2011treated Thai adults with HIV/TB co\u2011infection, CYP2B6 516TT strongly elevates efavirenz and, to a lesser extent, nevirapine concentrations, whereas rifampicin co\u2011administration exerts only modest influence on NNRTI levels. Genotype\u2011driven variability in exposure is much larger than rifampicin\u2019s inducing effect. Standard dosing achieved effective virologic suppression across genotypes, but CYP2B6 516TT remains an important marker for high NNRTI exposure and a potential target for individualized dosing.\n",
