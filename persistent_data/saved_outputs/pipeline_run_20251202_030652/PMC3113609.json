    "summary": "This pharmacogenomic study demonstrates that the class I HLA allele HLA-A*3101 is a strong genetic risk factor for carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity across the full clinical spectrum in individuals of European ancestry.\n\nStudy design and cohorts\n- Multicenter case\u2013control design, all subjects of European descent.\n- Discovery GWAS 1 (Liverpool):\n  - 22 cases with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (including DRESS) vs 2691 population controls.\n- Discovery GWAS 2 (EPIGEN):\n  - 43 cases with carbamazepine-induced maculopapular exanthema vs 1296 population controls.\n- Additional clinically ascertained cases:\n  - Hypersensitivity syndrome/AGEP: total 27 cases.\n  - Maculopapular exanthema: total 106 cases.\n  - SJS/TEN: 12 cases.\n- Clinical controls: 257 carbamazepine-tolerant epilepsy patients (no hypersensitivity after \u22653 months\u2019 exposure).\n\nMethods\n- Genome-wide genotyping (Illumina 1.2M and 610K) followed by association analysis with correction for population stratification.\n- Focused analysis of the MHC region on chromosome 6.\n- HLA alleles inferred by:\n  - Imputation from dense SNP\u2013HLA reference panels.\n  - Confirmation with high-resolution sequence-based HLA-A genotyping and an SNP proxy (rs1061235) known to be in perfect LD (r\u00b2=1) with HLA-A*3101 in Europeans.\n- Association statistics based on logistic regression and random-effects meta-analysis; genome-wide significance defined as P < 5\u00d710\u207b\u2078.\n\nKey genetic findings\n- A strong genome-wide significant association signal identified in the HLA region near HLA-A.\n- rs1061235, a perfect proxy for HLA-A*3101, was the top SNP in the hypersensitivity GWAS and mapped to HLA-A*3101.\n- Direct HLA genotyping showed 100% concordance with imputed HLA-A*3101.\n- No other HLA-A alleles showed significant association.\n\nPhenotype-specific effect sizes\nUsing clinical controls (n=257) with carbamazepine exposure but no hypersensitivity:\n- Hypersensitivity syndrome (plus AGEP, n=27):\n  - HLA-A*3101 frequency: ~40% in cases vs ~5% in controls.\n  - OR 12.41 (95% CI 1.27\u2013121.03), P=0.03.\n- Maculopapular exanthema (n=106):\n  - HLA-A*3101 frequency: ~27% in cases vs ~4% in controls in the GWAS subset; similar in the total series.\n  - Combined clinical analysis: OR 8.33 (95% CI 3.59\u201319.36), P=8.0\u00d710\u207b\u2077.\n- SJS/TEN (n=12):\n  - HLA-A*3101 present in 5/12 (42%) vs 10/257 (4%) controls.\n  - OR 25.93 (95% CI 4.93\u2013116.18), P=8.0\u00d710\u207b\u2075.\n- Pooled across all phenotypes (145 total hypersensitivity cases vs 257 tolerant controls):\n  - OR 9.12 (95% CI 4.03\u201320.65), P=1.0\u00d710\u207b\u2077.\n\nAllele frequency and clinical impact\n- HLA-A*3101 prevalence in Northern Europeans: approximately 2\u20135%.\n- Estimated baseline risk of clinically recognized carbamazepine hypersensitivity: ~5%.\n- Using pooled data for Europeans:\n  - Sensitivity of HLA-A*3101 for hypersensitivity: 26%.\n  - Specificity: 96%.\n  - Positive likelihood ratio: 6.74 (95% CI 3.51\u201313.00).\n  - Negative likelihood ratio: 0.77 (95% CI 0.67\u20130.84).\n- Translating to absolute risk:\n  - In carriers, risk increases from 5.0% to ~26.0% (\u22485-fold absolute risk increase).\n  - In noncarriers, risk decreases from 5.0% to ~3.8%.\n- Number needed to screen (NNS) to prevent one hypersensitivity case if carbamazepine is avoided in carriers:\n  - Using 5% prevalence: NNS ~83 in Europeans.\n  - Using 10% prevalence estimate from the SANAD trial: NNS ~39.\n\nContext versus HLA-B*1502\n- HLA-B*1502 is strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN in Han Chinese and other Asian populations but does not explain risk in Europeans and appears largely phenotype-specific for SJS/TEN.\n- In contrast, HLA-A*3101 in Europeans is associated with a broad clinical spectrum:\n  - Mild maculopapular rash,\n  - Hypersensitivity syndrome/DRESS-like presentations,\n  - Severe SJS/TEN.\n- HLA-A*3101 has also been implicated in carbamazepine hypersensitivity in Japanese and Han Chinese patients, suggesting a shared immunogenetic mechanism across ancestries, though allele frequency and test performance differ by population.\n\nPharmacogenomic implications\n- HLA-A*3101 is a clinically relevant marker for carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity in Europeans, though not as strongly predictive as HLA-B*5701 is for abacavir hypersensitivity.\n- Carriage of HLA-A*3101 substantially increases risk, but the allele is neither necessary nor sufficient for reaction; many carriers tolerate carbamazepine, and some noncarriers still develop hypersensitivity.\n- The test\u2019s high specificity means a positive result is informative (high post-test risk), while a negative result only modestly reduces risk.\n- The authors estimate that prospective HLA-A*3101 screening in Europeans could be clinically useful and potentially cost-effective, analogous (though not identical) to abacavir/HLA-B*5701 practice.\n- They suggest consideration of adding HLA-A*3101 risk information to the carbamazepine prescribing label and recommend further prospective studies and evaluation in additional ethnic groups.\n\nMechanistic considerations\n- Findings support a class I HLA-restricted, T cell\u2013mediated mechanism across multiple cutaneous phenotypes.\n- HLA-A*3101 may influence antigenic peptide presentation of carbamazepine or its metabolites, triggering drug-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses implicated in hypersensitivity syndromes and SJS/TEN.\n- There may be overlap in peptide-binding specificity between HLA-A*3101 and HLA-B*1502, but the causal HLA molecule and precise antigenic determinants remain to be definitively established.\n\nOverall conclusion\nHLA-A*3101 is a major genetic determinant of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in Europeans, spanning maculopapular exanthema, hypersensitivity/DRESS, and SJS/TEN. Pre-prescription HLA-A*3101 testing has the potential to identify a subgroup with markedly elevated risk (\u22481 in 4) and to modestly reduce risk in those testing negative, supporting the integration of this marker into carbamazepine pharmacogenomic risk stratification, especially in populations with similar HLA-A*3101 frequencies to Northern Europeans.",

                "On the basis of our hypothesis that the HLA-A\u26053101 allele is associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS\u2013TEN, we genotyped HLA-A\u26053101 in a group of 12 subjects with SJS\u2013TEN who were recruited from both the Liverpool and EPIGEN-affiliated centers. Of these 12 subjects, 5 (42%) carried the allele, as compared with 10 (4%) of the 257 clinical control subjects (odds ratio, 25.93; 95% CI, 4.93 to 116.18; P = 8.0\u00d710^\u22125^) ([Fig. 2](#F2)).",

                "We found that a variation in the presence of the HLA-A\u26053101 allele is an important predictor of the full spectrum of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in persons of European descent. Such reactions range from the relatively mild but nevertheless troublesome maculopapular exanthema to more severe reactions, such as the hypersensitivity syndrome and SJS\u2013TEN."
