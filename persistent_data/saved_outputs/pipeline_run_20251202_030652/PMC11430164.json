Michaelis\u2013Menten plots for each CYP3A4 variant were shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding kinetic parameters were summarized in Table 3. CYP3A4*30 (R130STOP) could not be determined because of no detectable enzymatic activity toward ticagrelor. Except for CYP3A4*30, the Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics of other 21 CYP3A4 variants could be determined. The estimated kinetic parameters Vmax, Km and CLint for AR-C124910XX of CYP3A4*1 were 1743.33 pmol/min/nmol, 2.18 \u00b5M and 800.45 \u00b5L/min/nmol, respectively. Almost of the variants exhibited changed Vmax or Km values compared with that of CYP3A4*1, which results in significant variations in CLint.",

Km values of all variants showed statistically increased (1.46\u201312.84 times of the wild-type). The ratio of Vmax and Km indicates the intrinsic clearance (CLint) values, which are considered the evaluation criterion for enzymatic activity. The relative clearance values between variants and wild-type can be determined by comparing their CLint ratios. Except for CYP3A4*30, the remaining 21 CYP3A4 variants could be classified into the following three categories according to the relative clearance values compare with CYP3A4*1: CYP3A4*11, CYP3A4*18 and CYP3A4*33 showed significantly higher intrinsic clearance than that of CYP3A4*1; four CYP3A4 variants (CYP3A4*10, CYP3A4*23, CYP3A4*32 and CYP3A4*34) were not significantly different from that of wild-type; the remaining fourteen variants (CYP3A4*2-*5, *9, *14-*17, *19, *24, *28, *29, and *31,) exhibited significantly reduced CLint in different degrees (1.48%\u201375.11% relative clearance) compared to that of wild-type.",

    "summary": "Study question and rationale:\nTicagrelor is almost entirely cleared by CYP3A4. Clinical bleeding and dyspnea correlate with ticagrelor (parent) exposure rather than its active metabolite AR\u2011C124910XX. CYP3A4 is highly polymorphic, and several alleles are enriched in the Chinese Han population, but their impact on ticagrelor metabolism has not been systematically characterized. This in\u2011vitro study functionally evaluates 22 CYP3A4 protein variants (plus the Chinese reference allele CYP3A4*1G, defined here functionally as wild-type *1) using ticagrelor as substrate.\n\nMethods:\n\u2022 Recombinant CYP3A4 enzymes: 22 allelic variants expressed in baculovirus\u2011infected insect cells, co\u2011incubated with cytochrome b5.\n\u2022 Ticagrelor concentrations: 1\u201350 \u00b5M, 30\u2011min incubations at 37 \u00b0C.\n\u2022 Product measured: AR\u2011C124910XX by validated UHPLC\u2013MS/MS (LLOQ 5 nM; good linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery, and negligible matrix effect).\n\u2022 Kinetic analysis: Michaelis\u2013Menten modeling (GraphPad Prism) to derive Vmax, Km, and intrinsic clearance (CLint = Vmax/Km). Relative clearance expressed as % of CYP3A4*1.\n\nKey kinetic findings (vs CYP3A4*1):\nWild-type (*1):\n\u2022 Vmax 1,743 pmol/min/nmol; Km 2.18 \u00b5M; CLint 800 \u00b5L/min/nmol (100%).\n\n1) Markedly increased intrinsic clearance (putative \u201cextensive/ultra-rapid\u201d ticagrelor metabolizers):\n\u2022 *11 (T363M): CLint 2,123 \u00b5L/min/nmol (264.7%).\n\u2022 *18 (L293P, common in Han Chinese): CLint 978 \u00b5L/min/nmol (122.5%).\n\u2022 *33 (A370S): CLint 940 \u00b5L/min/nmol (117.8%).\n\nThese alleles show substantially faster in\u2011vitro formation of AR\u2011C124910XX from ticagrelor. Clinically, carriers may have lower ticagrelor exposure and potentially attenuated risk of ticagrelor\u2011driven adverse events, but also a risk of underexposure if doses are not optimized.\n\n2) Near-normal intrinsic clearance (similar to *1 for ticagrelor):\n\u2022 *10 (D174H): CLint 889.7 \u00b5L/min/nmol (111.4%).\n\u2022 *23 (R162W): CLint 742.9 \u00b5L/min/nmol (92.8%).\n\u2022 *32 (I335T): CLint 833.1 \u00b5L/min/nmol (103.8%).\n\u2022 *34 (I427V): CLint 893.2 \u00b5L/min/nmol (111.9%).\n\nThese variants likely do not meaningfully alter ticagrelor metabolism relative to wild-type.\n\n3) Decreased intrinsic clearance (putative \u201cpoor to intermediate\u201d ticagrelor metabolizers):\nFourteen alleles had significantly reduced CLint (1.48\u201375.11% of wild-type):\n\u2022 Severely reduced activity:\n  \u2013 *24 (Q200H): CLint 11.9 \u00b5L/min/nmol (1.48% of *1); essentially minimal activity.\n  \u2013 *17 (F189S): CLint 37.8 \u00b5L/min/nmol (4.72%).\n\n\u2022 Moderately reduced activity:\n  \u2013 *2 (S222P): CLint 203.6 (25.5%).\n  \u2013 *14 (L15P): 229.8 (28.7%).\n  \u2013 *3 (M445T): 280.2 (35.0%).\n  \u2013 *16 (T185S): 360.1 (45.1%).\n  \u2013 *5 (P218R): 369.9 (46.3%).\n  \u2013 *28 (L22V): 425.1 (53.3%).\n  \u2013 *4 (I118V): 551.9 (68.8%).\n  \u2013 *19 (P467S): 539.7 (67.4%).\n  \u2013 *29 (F113I): 531.3 (66.5%).\n  \u2013 *15 (R162Q): 573.6 (71.8%).\n  \u2013 *9 (V170I): 599.7 (75.0%).\n  \u2013 *31 (H324Q): 601.2 (75.1%).\n\nMechanistically, most variants showed higher Km (reduced affinity) coupled with altered Vmax; the net effect is lower CLint. Carriers are expected to have slower ticagrelor clearance, higher plasma levels, and thus higher risk of concentration\u2011dependent adverse events (bleeding and ticagrelor\u2011associated dyspnea), analogous to the clinically characterized loss\u2011of\u2011function allele CYP3A4*22.\n\n4) No/weak activity:\n\u2022 *30 (R130STOP): no detectable activity for ticagrelor; kinetics not determined. This nonsense variant truncates the protein before the catalytic domain and likely represents a true loss\u2011of\u2011function allele.\n\nInterpretation and pharmacogenomic/clinical implications:\n\u2022 Ticagrelor is predominantly (\u224895%) cleared by CYP3A4, and clinical adverse reactions correlate with parent\u2011drug concentration, not with AR\u2011C124910XX.\n\u2022 CYP3A4 polymorphisms create a wide spectrum of in\u2011vitro ticagrelor metabolic capacities, from near-null (e.g., *24, *17, *30) to more than 2\u2011fold higher than wild-type (*11).\n\u2022 Given that therapeutic ticagrelor Cmax (~1 \u00b5M) is below the measured Km for all variants, in\u2011vivo metabolism is expected to behave in a first\u2011order, linear fashion; therefore, CLint differences are likely to translate fairly directly into differences in systemic exposure.\n\u2022 Poor-metabolizer genotypes (severely or moderately reduced activity alleles, especially *17, *24, and possibly *30 in compound heterozygotes) are expected to have higher ticagrelor exposure at standard doses and therefore heightened risk of bleeding and dyspnea. Dose reduction or therapeutic drug monitoring might be warranted in such carriers, particularly in the Chinese Han population where some of these alleles are enriched.\n\u2022 High-activity variants (*11, *18, *33) could predispose to lower ticagrelor levels and potentially lower risk of concentration\u2011dependent toxicity, but may necessitate attention to ensure adequate antiplatelet effect, especially in high\u2011risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients.\n\u2022 The work is entirely in vitro; no direct clinical pharmacokinetic or outcome data are provided for these alleles with ticagrelor. The authors emphasize that genotype\u2013phenotype extrapolation should be confirmed in vivo.\n\nStrengths and limitations:\nStrengths:\n\u2022 Systematic functional evaluation of a large panel of CYP3A4 alleles, including several Chinese\u2011specific or newly identified variants, using a validated UHPLC\u2013MS/MS assay.\n\u2022 Quantitative kinetic characterization (Vmax, Km, CLint) for each allele, enabling direct comparison and use in future physiologically based PK modeling.\n\nLimitations:\n\u2022 In-vitro recombinant system may not recapitulate full hepatic and intestinal expression, cofactor availability, or regulatory influences.\n\u2022 Allele frequencies and genotype combinations (e.g., compound heterozygotes) are not integrated into population\u2011level predictions.\n\u2022 No direct clinical PK/PD or bleeding outcome data tied to these specific alleles; thus, all clinical implications remain inferential.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nCYP3A4 genetic polymorphisms cause pronounced, allele\u2011specific differences in ticagrelor metabolism in vitro in a panel of 22 variants relevant to the Chinese Han population. Most variants deviate from wild-type activity, with several functioning as marked loss\u2011of\u2011function alleles and others as gain\u2011of\u2011function variants. Given the tight link between ticagrelor exposure and adverse events, CYP3A4 genotyping has potential utility for predicting ticagrelor pharmacokinetics, optimizing dosing, and refining bleeding/dyspnea risk stratification, although dedicated clinical validation studies are needed before implementation in routine care.\n\nKey translational points for pharmacogenomics:\n\u2022 Candidate \u201cpoor metabolizer\u201d alleles for ticagrelor: *17, *24, and likely *30 (null), plus additional decreased\u2011function alleles (*2, *3, *4, *5, *9, *14, *15, *16, *19, *28, *29, *31).\n\u2022 Candidate \u201crapid/extensive\u201d alleles for ticagrelor: *11, *18, *33.\n\u2022 These data could be incorporated into PBPK models and ultimately into allele\u2011specific dosing or monitoring algorithms for ticagrelor, especially in East Asian populations where several of these alleles are prevalent.\n\n(Article type: in\u2011vitro functional pharmacogenomics study; population focus: Chinese Han CYP3A4 allele spectrum.)",

Km values of all variants showed statistically increased (1.46\u201312.84 times of the wild-type). The ratio of Vmax and Km indicates the intrinsic clearance (CLint) values, which are considered the evaluation criterion for enzymatic activity. The relative clearance values between variants and wild-type can be determined by comparing their CLint ratios. Except for CYP3A4*30, the remaining 21 CYP3A4 variants could be classified into the following three categories according to the relative clearance values compare with CYP3A4*1: CYP3A4*11, CYP3A4*18 and CYP3A4*33 showed significantly higher intrinsic clearance than that of CYP3A4*1; four CYP3A4 variants (CYP3A4*10, CYP3A4*23, CYP3A4*32 and CYP3A4*34) were not significantly different from that of wild-type; the remaining fourteen variants (CYP3A4*2-*5, *9, *14-*17, *19, *24, *28, *29, and *31,) exhibited significantly reduced CLint in different degrees (1.48%\u201375.11% relative clearance) compared to that of wild-type.",
