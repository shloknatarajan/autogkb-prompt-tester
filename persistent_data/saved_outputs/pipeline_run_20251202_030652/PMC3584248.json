    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThe authors asked whether CYP2D6 genotype and, more importantly, directly measured endoxifen concentrations are associated with breast cancer recurrence in Asian women on adjuvant tamoxifen. This was an exploratory pharmacogenomic substudy nested within a randomized trial of adjuvant hormonal therapy in the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nPopulation and methods:\n- 224 Vietnamese and Filipino women with operable, hormone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer, all undergoing surgical oophorectomy and receiving tamoxifen 20 mg/day.\n- Blood samples collected \u22654 months after starting tamoxifen (steady state) for:\n  - CYP2D6 genotyping (*1, *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *10, *41).\n  - Measurement of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen (NDM-TAM), endoxifen, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen by LC\u2013MS/MS.\n- CYP2D6 phenotypic groups: normal (fully functional *1/*2), intermediate (reduced activity; typically one reduced-function allele such as *10 or *41), and slow (two reduced-function and/or null alleles).\n- Nested case\u2013control: 24 women with recurrence matched to 24 without recurrence (same hospital, stage I\u2013II vs III, and similar enrollment date; controls had at least as long follow\u2011up as the cases). Stratified Cox regression was used to model recurrence as a function of endoxifen.\n\nKey pharmacogenomic findings:\n1. CYP2D6 allele and genotype distribution\n- Very high prevalence of CYP2D6*10 (reduced function): 58.5% in Vietnamese and 52.4% in Filipinos.\n- Normal function alleles *1 and *2 together accounted for ~35% of alleles in Vietnamese and ~42% in Filipinos.\n- Null alleles (*3\u2013*6) were rare.\n\n2. CYP2D6 genotype \u2192 endoxifen levels\n- Endoxifen showed wide inter-patient variability.\n- Mean \u00b1 SD endoxifen (ng/mL):\n  - Normal metabolizers: 48.2 \u00b1 39.7\n  - Intermediate: 39.3 \u00b1 26.6\n  - Slow: 25.0 \u00b1 22.3\n- Highly significant gene\u2013dose trend: normal > intermediate > slow (p < 0.0001).\n- CYP2D6 genotype explained only about 10% of inter-individual variance in endoxifen (r\u00b2 \u2248 0.086), consistent with prior work showing that most variability is not captured by CYP2D6 alone.\n- CYP2D6 was only weakly related to tamoxifen, NDM-TAM, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen levels, as expected given their more complex biotransformation pathways.\n\nAssociation of endoxifen levels with recurrence:\n- Contrary to the dominant hypothesis (that low endoxifen causes higher recurrence), the data suggested a J-shaped relationship:\n  - A quadratic term for endoxifen (deviation from mean squared) in a Cox model stratified by matched pair was significantly associated with recurrence (likelihood ratio p = 0.002).\n  - Among those with very low endoxifen (< ~20 ng/mL), in 8 of 9 matched pairs the recurrent case had *lower* endoxifen than its control\u2014consistent with potential risk at very low levels.\n  - At high endoxifen levels (> ~70 ng/mL), recurrences also clustered. About 25% of recurrences had endoxifen >70 ng/mL, and in recurrences with very high levels, matched controls consistently had much lower concentrations.\n- Overall, the pattern suggested an \u201coptimal\u201d therapeutic endoxifen range, with possible increased recurrence risk both at the low and the high ends (J-shaped curve), and particularly an unexpected signal for increased risk above ~70 ng/mL.\n\nInterpretation and implications:\n- CYP2D6 genotype is significantly associated with endoxifen exposure in this Filipino/Vietnamese cohort, but explains only a modest fraction of variability; many other genetic and non-genetic factors likely contribute.\n- Measured endoxifen concentration appears more directly informative about tamoxifen pharmacodynamics than CYP2D6 genotype alone.\n- The novel observation is that very high endoxifen levels (>70 ng/mL) may be associated with *higher* recurrence risk, challenging the prevailing assumption that \u201chigher is always better\u201d for endoxifen.\n- These findings raise the possibility of an optimal therapeutic window for endoxifen concentrations rather than a monotonic benefit with increasing levels, with potential implications for:\n  - Tamoxifen dose escalation strategies in CYP2D6 poor/intermediate metabolizers.\n  - Development and dosing of oral endoxifen as a therapeutic agent.\n\nLimitations:\n- Exploratory, hypothesis-generating design with a small nested case\u2013control sample (24 recurrences, 24 controls).\n- Ancillary study population is not fully representative of the parent trial (some patients declined participation).\n- Follow-up and total event numbers are limited; residual confounding and chance findings are possible.\n- The J-shaped relationship and >70 ng/mL \u201chigh-risk\u201d threshold are not yet validated and should not be used for clinical decision-making without replication.\n\nConclusion:\n- CYP2D6 genotype significantly influences endoxifen levels in Filipino and Vietnamese women on tamoxifen, but explains only a minority of variability.\n- Endoxifen concentration itself appears to be a more promising biomarker of tamoxifen effect than CYP2D6 genotype alone.\n- The data suggest an optimal endoxifen concentration range; both very low and very high levels\u2014particularly >70 ng/mL\u2014might be associated with higher risk of recurrence. These provocative findings require confirmation in larger, prospective cohorts before guiding clinical practice.\n",
