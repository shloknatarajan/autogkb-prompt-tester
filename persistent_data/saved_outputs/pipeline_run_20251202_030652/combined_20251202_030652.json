    "summary": "This case\u2013control pharmacogenomic study in Han Chinese demonstrates an extremely strong association between the HLA\u2011B*5801 allele and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) caused by allopurinol, including drug hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\n\nStudy design and population:\n- 51 unrelated Han Chinese patients with allopurinol\u2011induced SCAR (13 SJS, 5 SJS/TEN overlap, 3 TEN, 30 HSS) recruited from multiple hospitals in Taiwan.\n- Two control groups:\n  - 135 allopurinol\u2011tolerant gout/hyperuricemia patients (\u22656 months\u2019 exposure, median 22 months, no adverse reactions).\n  - 93 healthy Han Chinese from a population biobank.\n- All SCAR cases had onset within 3 months of starting allopurinol, and causality was supported by resolution after withdrawal and (in a few) recurrence on re\u2011exposure.\n\nGenetic methods:\n- Initial screen: 823 SNPs in drug metabolism and immune-related genes, including 197 SNPs across the MHC region (6p21.3), genotyped by MALDI\u2011TOF.\n- Follow\u2011up: classical HLA typing (A, B, C, DRB1) with sequence\u2011specific oligonucleotide line blot and sequencing-based typing.\n- Association testing used Cochran\u2013Armitage trend test for SNPs and Fisher\u2019s exact test for HLA alleles; multiple-testing correction by Bonferroni.\n\nKey findings:\n1. MHC region signal:\n- In the SNP screen, 29 SNPs in the MHC region showed significant association with allopurinol\u2011SCAR.\n- Three class III region SNPs had P < 10\u207b\u2077: rs3117583 (BAT3), rs1150793 (MSH5), rs2855804 (MICB), indicating a strong MHC linkage.\n- Outside MHC, weak signals were observed at CFLAR (Casp8/FADD\u2011like apoptosis regulator) but not replicated for KIR2DL1.\n\n2. HLA-B*5801 association:\n- HLA\u2011B*5801 was present in 100% (51/51) of allopurinol\u2011SCAR patients.\n- Frequency in controls:\n  - 15% (20/135) of allopurinol\u2011tolerant patients.\n  - 20% (19/93) of population controls.\n- Effect estimates:\n  - vs tolerant controls: OR 580.3 (95% CI 34.4\u20139780.9), Pc = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2074.\n  - vs population controls: OR 393.5 (95% CI 23.2\u20136665.3), Pc = 8.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2078.\n- HLA\u2011B*5801 was not associated with the underlying diseases (e.g., gout, renal impairment) themselves.\n- The presence of B*5801 appears necessary but not sufficient: many tolerant patients also carried the allele.\n\n3. Extended HLA haplotype:\n- Additional alleles enriched in cases: HLA\u2011A*3303, Cw*0302, DRB1*0301.\n- A conserved extended haplotype was defined as A*3303\u2013Cw*0302\u2013B*5801\u2013DRB1*0301.\n- Frequencies of B*5801-linked markers:\n  - Cw*0302: 94% of SCAR vs 14% tolerant and 20% general population (OR ~98 vs tolerant).\n  - A*3303: 67% vs 18% vs 22%.\n  - DRB1*0301: 65% vs 13% vs 15%.\n- Full extended haplotype (A*3303\u2013Cw*0302\u2013B*5801\u2013DRB1*0301): present in 41% of SCAR patients vs 7% tolerant and 10% general controls.\n\n4. Clinical covariates and co\u2011risk factors:\n- Chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine \u22651.7 mg/dL \u22656 months) was significantly more frequent in SCAR cases (55%) than tolerant controls (21%), with OR 4.7 (95% CI ~2.3\u20139.3), confirming renal insufficiency as an independent clinical risk factor.\n- All SCAR cases developed reactions within 3 months of starting allopurinol; in three patients, re\u2011exposure caused rapid recurrence.\n- Thiazide use was similar between groups and not significantly associated.\n- SCAR patients overall received lower median daily allopurinol doses but for a much shorter duration than tolerant controls, consistent with acute intolerance rather than dose\u2011dependent toxicity.\n\nPharmacogenomic interpretation and implications:\n- This study identifies HLA\u2011B*5801 as a powerful genetic marker of susceptibility to allopurinol\u2011induced SCAR in Han Chinese, with effect sizes surpassing many classical HLA\u2013disease associations (e.g., HLA\u2011B27 and ankylosing spondylitis).\n- Because B*5801 is present in a significant minority of the general Han Chinese population (~15\u201320%), pre\u2011treatment HLA\u2011B*5801 screening could be an effective strategy to prevent allopurinol\u2011induced SCAR in this population, particularly in patients with additional risk factors such as chronic kidney disease.\n- However, not all B*5801 carriers develop SCAR when exposed to allopurinol, indicating that B*5801 is necessary but not sufficient. Non\u2011genetic modifiers (renal function, possibly infections) and additional genetic loci (e.g., CFLAR) may modulate risk.\n- Mechanistically, the authors propose that specific HLA\u2011B molecules (here B*5801; previously B*1502 for carbamazepine SJS/TEN and B*5701 for abacavir hypersensitivity) may present the culprit drug or its reactive metabolite as a neo\u2011antigenic peptide to T cells, initiating a cytotoxic immune response that underlies SCAR.\n\nClinical relevance for pharmacogenomics:\n- This landmark study, along with later confirmatory work, underpins current guideline recommendations (e.g., CPIC, many Asian rheumatology/dermatology societies) to avoid starting allopurinol in HLA\u2011B*5801\u2013positive Han Chinese and several other high\u2011prevalence Asian populations.\n- For patients with gout or hyperuricemia who carry HLA\u2011B*5801, alternative urate\u2011lowering therapy should be considered (e.g., febuxostat, uricosurics where appropriate), especially when renal insufficiency is present.\n\nTitle: \u201cHLA-B*5801 allele as a genetic marker for severe cutaneous adverse reactions caused by allopurinol\u201d\n\nPMID: 15743917\n\nPMCID: PMC554812",

    "summary": "Design and population\n- Prospective, multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized clinical trial (PLATELET) at 37 sites in South Korea.\n- Enrolled adults with acute ischemic stroke who started clopidogrel (75\u2013300 mg) within 72 hours of symptom onset and underwent CYP2C19 genotyping.\n- Key exclusions: need for anticoagulation or non\u2013aspirin antiplatelets, recent clopidogrel use, planned coronary/cerebral revascularization within 6 months, major comorbidities, high\u2011risk cardioembolic stroke (by TOAST), or participation in other trials.\n- Final analysis: 2910 patients (mean age 65.3 years; 66.3% men).\n- CYP2C19 phenotypes (based on *1, *2, *3, *17):\n  - LOF carriers (intermediate or poor metabolizers): 1785 (61.3%)\n  - Noncarriers (extensive metabolizers): 1125 (38.7%)\n  - Intermediate: 47.8%; poor: 13.5%.\n- Baseline demographics, risk factors, stroke mechanism (TOAST), NIHSS, concomitant aspirin/statin use, and laboratory indices were well balanced between LOF carriers and noncarriers, except prior cerebral infarction was slightly more frequent in carriers (8.9% vs 6.6%).\n\nExposure and genotyping\n- All patients received clopidogrel throughout the 6\u2011month follow\u2011up; aspirin plus clopidogrel was allowed at physician discretion; other antiplatelets/anticoagulants were restricted.\n- CYP2C19 genotypes measured for *1, *2, *3, *17.\n  - Extensive metabolizers (LOF noncarriers): *1/*1, *1/*17, *17/*17.\n  - Intermediate metabolizers: one LOF allele (*1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*17, *3/*17).\n  - Poor metabolizers: two LOF alleles (*2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3).\n- Primary pharmacogenomic contrast: LOF carriers (intermediate + poor) vs noncarriers (extensive).\n\nOutcomes\n- Primary effectiveness outcome: composite 6\u2011month cardiovascular events (recurrent ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death).\n- Secondary effectiveness outcomes: individual ischemic stroke, TIA, MI, coronary revascularization, early neurologic deterioration (END \u22647 days), and functional outcome at 3 months (mRS 0\u20132).\n- Safety outcomes: major bleeding (intracranial, fatal, ocular, bleeding requiring \u22652 units transfusion or hospitalization) and all\u2011cause mortality over 6 months.\n- Analyses: intention\u2011to\u2011treat, Kaplan\u2013Meier with log\u2011rank, Cox models with multivariable adjustment; sensitivity analysis with propensity\u2011weighted matching; preplanned subgroups (sex, hypertension, diabetes, NIHSS, TOAST, smoking, etc.).\n\nKey results\n1. Primary composite cardiovascular outcome\n- Events at 6 months:\n  - LOF carriers: 49/1785 (2.7%)\n  - Noncarriers: 18/1125 (1.6%)\n- Noncarriers had a significantly lower risk:\n  - HR for noncarriers vs carriers: 0.58 (95% CI, 0.34\u20130.99); log\u2011rank P = 0.048.\n- In multivariable Cox analysis (adjusted for age, sex, vascular risk factors, TOAST, eGFR, PRU, NIHSS, aspirin use, prior vascular disease), LOF noncarrier status remained protective:\n  - Adjusted HR 0.58 (95% CI, 0.33\u20130.99; P = 0.049).\n\n2. Recurrent stroke\n- Recurrent stroke at 6 months:\n  - LOF carriers: 45/1785 (2.5%)\n  - Noncarriers: 16/1125 (1.4%)\n- Noncarriers again had a lower risk:\n  - HR for noncarriers vs carriers: 0.56 (95% CI, 0.32\u20131.00); P = 0.047.\n- Ischemic stroke alone showed a similar numeric pattern (2.4% vs 1.4%; P = 0.06) but did not reach conventional significance.\n\n3. Other effectiveness outcomes\n- MI: rare and similar (0.1% vs 0.2%; P = 0.64).\n- Cardiovascular death: 2 events in carriers vs 0 in noncarriers (not statistically different).\n- TIA, coronary revascularization, END, and 3\u2011month functional outcome (mRS 0\u20132 ~82% in both groups) were not significantly different.\n\n4. Safety outcomes\n- Major bleeding:\n  - LOF carriers: 11/1785 (0.6%)\n  - Noncarriers: 9/1125 (0.8%)\n  - HR 1.29 (95% CI, 0.53\u20133.13); P = 0.56.\n- All\u2011cause mortality:\n  - LOF carriers: 5/1785 (0.3%)\n  - Noncarriers: 1/1125 (0.1%)\n  - HR 0.31 (95% CI, 0.04\u20132.71); P = 0.27.\n- Thus, genotype\u2011dependent differences in cardiovascular efficacy were not accompanied by differences in bleeding or mortality.\n\n5. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses\n- Subgroups: no meaningful heterogeneity by age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, NIHSS, or TOAST, except for smoking:\n  - Among smokers, the primary outcome was significantly less frequent in noncarriers vs carriers (HR 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01\u20130.64; P = 0.02; Pinteraction = 0.03), suggesting a particularly strong genotype effect in smokers.\n- Intermediate vs poor metabolizers (within LOF carriers): no significant difference in primary outcome or in patients on dual therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel). No primary events occurred among those on clopidogrel monotherapy, precluding comparison.\n- Propensity\u2011weighted analyses produced results consistent with the primary findings, supporting robustness to measured confounding.\n\n6. Multivariable predictors\n- In adjusted models:\n  - CYP2C19 LOF noncarrier status: protective (HR 0.58).\n  - TOAST small\u2011vessel occlusion: protective vs other mechanisms (HR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19\u20130.71; P = 0.003).\n  - NIHSS 3\u20135 category also appeared associated with fewer composite events vs NIHSS \u22641; higher NIHSS >5 did not significantly differ from very low NIHSS, suggesting a non\u2011linear relationship, potentially driven by low overall event rates.\n- Traditional vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking), renal function, and prior vascular history were not independently associated with the composite outcome in this relatively short (6\u2011month), low\u2011event setting.\n\nPharmacogenomic interpretation\n- Clopidogrel is a prodrug requiring bioactivation via CYP2C19. LOF alleles (*2, *3) reduce active metabolite formation, leading to high on\u2011treatment platelet reactivity and reduced antiplatelet efficacy.\n- This trial directly links CYP2C19 LOF carrier status to a higher incidence of clinically important vascular events in a real\u2011world acute ischemic stroke cohort treated uniformly with clopidogrel.\n- The genotype effect appears driven mainly by recurrent stroke rather than MI or cardiovascular death, which were rare.\n- The absence of a bleeding signal suggests that the genotype effect is selective for efficacy (insufficient platelet inhibition) rather than safety.\n- Findings align with prior Asian data (e.g., CHANCE and CHANCE\u20112) and meta\u2011analyses showing worse outcomes with clopidogrel in CYP2C19 LOF carriers, especially in populations where LOF allele frequency is high (~60% in Asians).\n- Intermediate and poor metabolizers did not significantly differ from each other, implying that even a single LOF allele (intermediate metabolizer status) may be sufficient to meaningfully blunt clopidogrel effect in this clinical context.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics\n- Among Korean (and more broadly, East Asian) patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel, CYP2C19 LOF carriers are at higher risk of composite cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke over 6 months, with no offsetting reduction in bleeding.\n- These data support the concept of genotype\u2011guided antiplatelet selection:\n  - For LOF carriers, alternative P2Y12 inhibitors such as ticagrelor (whose efficacy is genotype\u2011independent) may be preferable, as supported by CHANCE\u20112.\n  - For noncarriers (extensive metabolizers), clopidogrel remains an effective and safe option.\n- Because ~60% of Asians are LOF carriers, the clinical yield of CYP2C19 testing is particularly high in this population. The study reinforces existing CPIC guidance and growing expert consensus recommending consideration of CYP2C19 genotyping when choosing clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention in populations with high LOF prevalence.\n- The notable interaction with smoking raises the possibility that smokers who are noncarriers may derive particular benefit from clopidogrel, but this finding is exploratory and should not alter practice without confirmation.\n\nLimitations relevant to interpretation\n- Nonrandomized, open\u2011label design: although clopidogrel use was universal and outcomes were adjudicated blinded to genotype, residual confounding by unmeasured factors cannot be excluded.\n- Follow\u2011up limited to 6 months; long\u2011term genotype effects beyond this window remain uncertain.\n- Conducted exclusively in South Korea; generalizability to non\u2011Asian populations (where LOF frequencies are lower and risk profiles differ) is limited.\n- No information on precise timing of clopidogrel initiation within the 72\u2011hour window or loading dose; potential early differences cannot be explored.\n- Only CYP2C19 *1, *2, *3, *17 were assessed; other genes (e.g., ABCB1, CES1, PON1) and non\u2011CYP2C19 pathways influencing clopidogrel response were not evaluated.\n- Overall event rates were low, leading to relatively wide CIs and limited power for some subgroup and secondary analyses.\n\nBottom line\n- In a large, prospective Korean cohort with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel, CYP2C19 loss\u2011of\u2011function alleles were associated with a significantly higher 6\u2011month risk of composite cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke, without increased bleeding or mortality.\n- These results strengthen the evidence base for CYP2C19 genotype\u2013guided antiplatelet therapy in acute ischemic stroke, particularly in Asian populations, and support considering non\u2013CYP2C19\u2013dependent agents (e.g., ticagrelor) for LOF carriers.\n\nTitle\nCytochrome P450 2C19 Genotypes and Clopidogrel in Patients With Ischemic Stroke: A Nonrandomized Clinical Trial\n\nPMID\n40184070\n\nPMCID\nPMC11971672",

    "summary": "Study question and rationale:\nThis pharmacogenomic analysis asked whether germline CYP2D6 metabolizer status predicts outcomes in postmenopausal women with ER-positive early breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, and whether any effect is specific to periods of tamoxifen exposure versus after switching to an aromatase inhibitor. The work responds to conflicting literature on CYP2D6\u2013tamoxifen associations and concerns about genotyping quality and trial design in prior negative studies.\n\nTrial and design:\n- Parent trial: ABCSG-8, a large, prospective, randomized, open-label study of 3,901 postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive, early-stage, node-positive or node-negative, grade 1\u20132 breast cancer, treated without chemotherapy.\n- Arms:\n  - Arm A: 5 years tamoxifen 20 mg/day.\n  - Arm B: 2 years tamoxifen 20 mg/day \u2192 then 3 years anastrozole 1 mg/day.\n- Pharmacogenetic substudy: retrospective, matched case\u2013control within ABCSG-8 using archived paraffin blocks containing normal and tumor tissue.\n\nCases and controls:\n- Cases: women with an eligible first event during defined follow-up windows: local/regional/distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, second non-breast primary, or death (invasive DFS definition, STEEP criteria). Events beyond 5 years were excluded due to lack of systematic data on extended endocrine therapy and enrollment into a separate extension trial (ABCSG-16/SALSA).\n- Controls: for each case, 1\u20132 controls (optimal matching) from the same arm, with:\n  - Age within 5 years.\n  - Same surgical/radiation category (BCS\u00b1RT vs mastectomy\u00b1RT).\n  - Same tumor stage (I vs II/III) and nodal status (positive vs negative).\n  - Longer follow-up (time at risk) than the corresponding case.\n- Final dataset: 319 cases and 557 controls (238 cases with 2 controls; 81 with 1 control) from 1,589 patients with available tissue.\n\nCYP2D6 genotyping and phenotype assignment:\n- DNA source: three 10-\u00b5m whole-tissue sections from FFPE blocks containing both normal and tumor tissue, to mitigate artifactual loss of CYP2D6 signal from 22q13 loss of heterozygosity.\n- SNPs/alleles genotyped:\n  - Null (poor function) alleles: *3 (2549delA), *4 (1846G>A), *6 (1707delT).\n  - Reduced-function alleles: *10 (defined by 100C>T and 1846G>A haplotype), *41 (2988G>A).\n- CYP2D6 *5 (gene deletion) and duplications were not assessable due to FFPE DNA fragmentation; multiple quality controls and TaqMan assay validation were used.\n- Phenotype categories (as in earlier Schroth et al work):\n  - EM/EM: no null or reduced-function alleles.\n  - EM/IM and IM/IM: one or two reduced alleles only, no null alleles.\n  - EM/PM or PM/IM: one null allele (with or without reduced allele).\n  - PM/PM: two null alleles (poor metabolizers).\n- Use of CYP2D6-inhibiting co-medications (e.g., certain SSRIs) was not recorded; such drugs were not recommended for hot flashes in the trial but cannot be excluded.\n\nGenetic quality and allele frequencies:\n- Genotyping success rates: >98% for *4, *6, *10, *41; ~84% for the rarer *3.\n- Observed minor allele frequencies in this largely Caucasian cohort:\n  - *3: q \u2248 0.01\n  - *4: q \u2248 0.21\n  - *6: q \u2248 0.01\n  - *10: q \u2248 0.03\n  - *41: q \u2248 0.09\n- Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE):\n  - *4, *6, *10 were in HWE (e.g., *4 p=0.07).\n  - Deviations for *3 (p=0.003) and *41 (p=0.009) were modest. Authors suggest possible contribution from somatic deletion at 22q13 or ungenotyped *5 deletions leading to an apparent heterozygote deficit.\n- Importantly, the clinically key *4 allele\u2014central to previous controversies\u2014was in HWE, supporting genotyping validity, in contrast to strong HWE deviations reported in some earlier large trials (e.g., BIG 1-98, ATAC).\n\nClinical characteristics:\n- 166 cases/287 controls from Arm A; 153 cases/270 controls from Arm B.\n- Median age ~66\u201369 years; most had stage I disease (\u224861%) and node-negative status (~62%). All tumors were hormone receptor\u2013positive; HER2 positivity was low (~7%). No major imbalances between cases and matched controls across arms due to strict matching.\n- First events among 319 cases: ~28% distant recurrence, ~13% local recurrence, ~9% contralateral breast cancer, ~29% second (non-breast) primary, ~25% death.\n\nPrimary pharmacogenomic findings (years 0\u20135 by arm):\n- Analysis: conditional logistic regression for matched sets, examining odds of a disease event according to CYP2D6 phenotype.\n\nArm A (5 years tamoxifen monotherapy):\n- PM/PM vs EM/EM:\n  - OR 2.45 (95% CI 1.05\u20135.73), p=0.04.\n  - Indicates significantly higher odds of an early disease event in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n- EM/PM or PM/IM vs EM/EM (\u22651 null allele but not PM/PM):\n  - OR 1.67 (95% CI 0.95\u20132.93), p=0.07 (trend toward higher risk).\n- EM/IM or IM/IM vs EM/EM (only reduced-function alleles, no null alleles):\n  - OR 1.23 (95% CI 0.58\u20132.61), p=0.60 (no evidence of increased risk).\n- Interpreted as a gene\u2013dose effect for null alleles: greatest risk in two-null (PM/PM), intermediate in one-null, minimal in reduced-only genotypes.\n\nArm B (2 years tamoxifen \u2192 3 years anastrozole, 0\u20135 years combined):\n- PM/PM vs EM/EM:\n  - OR 0.60 (95% CI 0.15\u20132.37), p=0.47.\n- EM/PM or PM/IM vs EM/EM:\n  - OR 0.76 (95% CI 0.43\u20131.31), p=0.32.\n- EM/IM or IM/IM vs EM/EM:\n  - OR 1.02 (95% CI 0.52\u20132.01), p=0.96.\n- No significant association between CYP2D6 phenotype and event risk across the whole 5-year sequence, implying that the detrimental impact seen in Arm A is not apparent when patients switch to anastrozole after 2 years.\n\nTime-window analyses (mechanistic dissection):\nGiven the contrasting results between Arms A and B, the authors split follow-up into the tamoxifen-only period (years 1\u20132) and years 3\u20135 (tamoxifen vs anastrozole):\n\nYears 1\u20132 (all patients on tamoxifen):\n- Events were few, limiting power; estimates are imprecise but directionally consistent.\n- PM/PM vs EM/EM:\n  - Arm A: OR 2.54, p=0.25.\n  - Arm B: OR 2.60, p=0.46.\n- These point estimates suggest higher early risk in PM/PM while on tamoxifen, but wide CIs preclude firm conclusions.\n\nYears 3\u20135 (tamoxifen continuation vs anastrozole switch):\n- Restricted to women event-free in first 2 years.\n\nArm A (continued tamoxifen):\n- PM/PM vs EM/EM:\n  - OR 2.40 (95% CI 0.86\u20136.66), p=0.09 (trend toward increased risk).\n- EM/PM or PM/IM vs EM/EM:\n  - OR 1.70 (95% CI 0.91\u20133.17), p=0.09 (trend toward increased risk).\n- Again, directionally consistent with main 0\u20135 year analysis: reduced CYP2D6 activity confers higher risk during ongoing tamoxifen.\n\nArm B (switched to anastrozole):\n- PM/PM vs EM/EM:\n  - OR 0.28, p=0.23.\n- EM/PM or PM/IM vs EM/EM:\n  - OR 0.63, p=0.22.\n- Although not statistically significant, point estimates trend toward *lower* odds of events in PM categories once patients are on anastrozole, suggesting that any disadvantage of low CYP2D6 activity is not only absent but potentially reversed after switching to an AI.\n\nInterpretation and mechanistic implications:\n- Tamoxifen is a prodrug converted by CYP2D6 into endoxifen, a potent anti-estrogen. Prior pharmacokinetic data show a stepwise reduction in plasma endoxifen with increasing burden of null alleles.\n- This analysis supports a pharmacologically coherent model:\n  - During active tamoxifen therapy, women with CYP2D6 PM/PM or one null allele have a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence or related events, consistent with reduced formation of endoxifen.\n  - Reduced-function alleles without null alleles (IM only) have less clear impact.\n  - Once tamoxifen is stopped and therapy is switched to anastrozole (whose metabolism depends primarily on CYP3A and UGTs, not CYP2D6), CYP2D6 genotype no longer predicts worse outcomes and may even show a protective trend.\n- Clinical implication: the apparent \u201cnegative\u201d CYP2D6\u2013tamoxifen associations in some recent large trials may be obscured by inclusion of patients who switched from tamoxifen to an AI; if outcomes are analyzed without segregating tamoxifen-exposure time, a true pharmacogenomic signal present only during tamoxifen administration may be diluted or annulled.\n\nMethodological strengths:\n- Embedded in a randomized clinical trial with standardized endocrine regimens, high-quality clinical outcome data, and no confounding chemotherapy.\n- Rigorous matching of cases and controls on key prognostic factors and exposure time, which improves internal validity and power.\n- Use of tissue sections containing both tumor and normal cells, plus detailed attention to genotyping quality and HWE, which addresses major methodological criticisms of earlier studies.\n- Inclusion of more than half of all early events (214 of 408 first events in first 5 years), making the genotyped sample more representative of the parent tamoxifen population than in some prior analyses (e.g., ATAC\u2019s ~18.9% sample).\n\nKey limitations:\n- Retrospective use of archived tissue; germline DNA (e.g., blood) was not prospectively collected.\n- CYP2D6 *5 deletion and gene duplications were not genotyped, so some metabolizer categorization may be misclassified.\n- No data on concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., certain antidepressants, other medications), which also influence endoxifen levels.\n- Focus on early events (0\u20135 years); the study cannot address whether CYP2D6 genotype influences very late recurrences after endocrine therapy ends.\n- Number of PM/PM patients and some subgroups is modest; some analyses border on statistical significance and require cautious interpretation.\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- In a well-conducted trial context, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status (two null alleles) is associated with substantially higher odds of early recurrence or related events for women treated with 5 years of tamoxifen alone.\n- Switching to anastrozole after 2 years appears to mitigate\u2014perhaps negate\u2014the adverse effect of reduced CYP2D6 metabolism, consistent with anastrozole\u2019s CYP2D6-independent pharmacology.\n- For pharmacogenomics practice and trial design:\n  - Analyses of CYP2D6 and tamoxifen need to be stratified by actual tamoxifen exposure and subsequent AI use, rather than lumping all endocrine therapy together.\n  - Future prospective studies could test genotype-guided strategies: e.g., up-front AI therapy, altered tamoxifen dosing, extended AI after shorter tamoxifen, or direct endoxifen administration in patients with reduced CYP2D6 activity.\n  - Measuring circulating endoxifen concentrations may complement genotyping and could be used to individualize therapy.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nThe ABCSG-8 pharmacogenomic substudy supports CYP2D6 as a clinically relevant determinant of tamoxifen effectiveness, but only during periods when tamoxifen is actually being administered. This effect is not observed\u2014and may be reversed\u2014once therapy is switched to anastrozole. The work helps reconcile divergent literature by highlighting the importance of treatment sequencing, exposure windows, and rigorous genotyping methodology when evaluating the CYP2D6\u2013tamoxifen relationship.\n",

    "summary": "Study design and population:\n- Retrospective nested case\u2013control pharmacogenomic study in 82 Chilean patients with advanced (stage III\u2013IV) colorectal adenocarcinoma treated first\u2011line with 5\u2011FU/capecitabine\u2011based regimens (mainly FOLFOX or CAPOX; many with oxaliplatin). \n- Sixteen pre\u2011selected variants were genotyped in 10 genes involved in 5\u2011FU activation/inactivation, folate cycle, oxaliplatin detoxification and DNA repair, and drug transport: TYMS, TYMP, DPYD, GSTP1, MTHFR, ERCC2, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC4, ABCG2.\n- Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were abstracted cycle\u2011by\u2011cycle from clinical records and graded using CTCAE v5.0, then grouped into system categories (GI, hematologic, nervous system, skin/subcutaneous, fatigue, pain) and also analyzed as individual toxicities (e.g., neuropathy, mucositis, anemia).\n\nKey pharmacogenetic findings (univariate):\n1. TYMS 3\u2032UTR 6\u2011bp ins/del (rs11280056)\n- DEL carriers had substantially *lower* risk of toxicity:\n  - Gastrointestinal disorders: DEL/DEL vs INS/INS OR\u22480.10 (p\u22480.045).\n  - Hematologic disorders: very strong protection\n    - INS/DEL vs INS/INS OR 0.16 (p=0.002), DEL/DEL vs INS/INS OR 0.03 (p=0.001).\n    - Dominant model (any DEL vs INS/INS) OR 0.11 (p<0.0001); recessive DEL/DEL OR 0.08 (p=0.015).\n  - Severe (grade 3\u20134) hematologic toxicity: DEL carriers also protected (dominant OR\u22480.10; p=0.005).\n- This is directionally opposite to some prior reports linking this variant to higher toxicity, suggesting possible population\u2011specific effects or limited power in earlier studies.\n\n2. TYMS 5\u2032UTR TSER VNTR (2R/3R, rs45445694)\n- 3R/3R genotype increased risk of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\n  - Recessive model (3R/3R vs 2R/2R + 2R/3R): OR 6.40 (p=0.029).\n- Reinforces that TYMS expression variants can influence non\u2011hematologic toxicity patterns under fluoropyrimidines.\n\n3. DPYD c.85T>C (DPYD*9, rs1801265)\n- High\u2011frequency DPYD variant (C allele present in ~40% of cohort) that does *not* cause classic complete DPD deficiency.\n- C allele associated with greater neuropathy risk:\n  - Dominant model (T/C + C/C vs T/T) OR 4.58 (p=0.05).\n  - More extreme effect seen in codominant analysis (T/C OR 30; p=0.0049) in ungrouped ADR analysis (neuropathy specifically).\n- Foundational evidence that common, non\u2013loss\u2011of\u2011function DPYD variants may still modulate neurotoxicity risk in 5\u2011FU/oxaliplatin settings.\n\n4. GSTP1 c.313A>G (rs1695)\n- Key enzyme in glutathione\u2011mediated detoxification of oxaliplatin.\n- G allele had *dual* and directionally opposite effects:\n  - Protective against hematologic toxicity:\n    - Dominant (A/G+G/G vs A/A): OR 0.30 (p=0.001).\n    - Recessive (G/G vs A/A+A/G): OR 0.16 (p=0.0005).\n  - Protective against nervous system disorders overall and specifically neuropathy:\n    - Recessive (G/G) for nervous system disorders: OR 0.18 (p=0.020).\n    - For neuropathy as an individual ADR (supplementary): OR\u22480.01 (p=0.008), i.e., very strong protection.\n  - *Increased* risk of mucositis (GI mucosal toxicity): OR 2.27 (p=0.036).\n- This split phenotype (less neuropathy, more mucositis) is novel and suggests tissue\u2011specific impact of altered GSTP1 activity on 5\u2011FU/oxaliplatin disposition and local damage.\n\n5. ERCC2 (XPD) c.2251A>C (rs13181)\n- DNA repair gene involved in nucleotide excision repair, relevant for oxaliplatin\u2011induced DNA adduct repair.\n- C/C genotype associated with *lower* risk of GI disorders (codominant model, OR 0.10; p=0.045).\n- In multivariate analysis (see below), ERCC2 C/C instead emerged as a *risk factor* for pain, underscoring that effects may differ by toxicity domain.\n\n6. TYMP (TP) c.1412C>T (rs11479)\n- Missense variant in thymidine phosphorylase, involved in capecitabine \u2192 5\u2011FU activation and in 5\u2011FU activation cascade.\n- T allele (C/T + T/T) increased risk of pain:\n  - Dominant model OR 5.86 (p=0.027).\n- Consistent with previous work linking rs11479 to earlier onset of fluoropyrimidine toxicity.\n\n7. MTHFR c.1298A>C (rs1801131)\n- Folate cycle variant affecting MTHFR activity (and hence TS cofactor availability).\n- C allele showed divergent toxicity patterns:\n  - Protective against pain: dominant model (A/C + C/C vs A/A) OR 0.38 (p=0.048).\n  - Associated with higher risk of nervous system disorders (dominant OR 5.81; p=0.035).\n- Adds to heterogeneous literature on MTHFR variants and fluoropyrimidine toxicity (hematologic vs mucosal vs neurologic).\n\n8. ABCB1 c.1236T>C (rs1128503)\n- Transporter involved in efflux of multiple drugs including 5\u2011FU/oxaliplatin metabolites.\n- C/C genotype associated with higher risk of pain (recessive model OR 4.20; p=0.049).\n\n9. ADR pattern in the cohort\n- Any GI disorders: 82.9% of patients, with mucositis in 34.1% and vomiting in 29.4%.\n- Nervous system disorders: 74.5% overall, neuropathy in 37.8%.\n- Hematologic disorders in 40.2% (anemia in 20.7%; thrombocytopenia in 17.1%).\n- Pain: 46.3%; fatigue: 53.7%; skin/subcutaneous disorders: 19.6%.\n- Majority of ADRs were grade 0\u20132; severe (grade 3\u20134) events were less frequent but still clinically important.\n\nMultivariate predictive models:\n1. Anemia risk model (ungrouped ADR)\n- Variables: TYMP rs11479 (T/T vs others), ABCB1 rs1045642 (T/T vs C carriers; note 1045642 is a different ABCB1 locus than 1128503, but is tightly linked).\n- Inheritance: both coded recessively.\n- Final logistic model:\n  - TYMP rs11479 T/T: OR 23.76 (95% CI 1.72\u2013986.65; p=0.038) \u2013 strong independent risk factor for anemia.\n  - ABCB1 rs1045642 T/T: trend toward protection (OR 0.15; p=0.093), not statistically significant.\n- Performance:\n  - Model p\u2011value=0.027; pseudo\u2011R\u00b2=0.145.\n  - Accuracy 71.8%, sensitivity 23.1% (low; model better at ruling out than ruling in anemia).\n  - AUC\u22480.71.\n- Interpretation: a homozygous TYMP rs11479 T/T genotype substantially increases anemia risk during 5\u2011FU\u2013based therapy in this population, but the model needs refinement and external validation.\n\n2. Pain risk model\n- Variables: ERCC2 rs13181 (C/C), MTHFR rs1801131 (A/C + C/C dominant).\n- ERCC2 C/C: independent *risk factor* for pain (OR 6.27; p=0.034).\n- MTHFR A/C or C/C: independent *protective* factor (OR 0.16; p=0.034).\n- Performance:\n  - Model p\u2011value=0.01; pseudo\u2011R\u00b2=0.185.\n  - Accuracy 72.2%, sensitivity 62.5%.\n  - AUC\u22480.75.\n- Suggests that combined DNA\u2011repair capacity (ERCC2) and folate pathway status (MTHFR) meaningfully stratify risk of clinically significant pain during treatment.\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- DPYD: No variability for guideline\u2011listed high\u2011risk loss\u2011of\u2011function alleles (DPYD*2A, DPYD*13) in this 82\u2011patient cohort, highlighting population\u2011specific allele frequencies; however, the common DPYD*9 (rs1801265) still associated with neuropathy, supporting more comprehensive DPYD characterization (haplotypes or exome sequencing) beyond the canonical four variants.\n- TYMS: Both 3\u2032UTR ins/del and 5\u2032UTR TSER VNTR influence toxicity profiles (hematologic/GI vs skin), reinforcing TYMS as a key pharmacodynamic locus in fluoropyrimidine therapy, but with variable direction of effect across studies and populations.\n- GSTP1: Data strongly support rs1695 as a clinically relevant predictor of oxaliplatin\u2011related neuropathy in Chilean CRC patients, but the newly described association with mucositis warns that reducing neuropathy by genotype\u2011guided dosing might trade off against higher mucosal toxicity.\n- Folate pathway (MTHFR) and DNA repair (ERCC2) variants jointly shape risk of pain and neurologic toxicity, emphasizing multi\u2011gene, pathway\u2011level interactions.\n- Transporters (ABCB1) and activation enzymes (TYMP) may be particularly relevant for anemia and pain, though current multivariate models are exploratory and require larger validation cohorts before clinical adoption.\n\nLimitations:\n- Small sample (n=82) and multiple testing without strong correction raise risk of type I error; several estimates have very wide CIs.\n- Retrospective design with heterogeneous regimens (5\u2011FU vs capecitabine; \u00b1oxaliplatin, irinotecan, biologics) and potential under\u2011reporting of low\u2011grade ADRs.\n- Chilean cohort; allele frequencies and effect sizes may differ substantially from European or Asian populations.\n\nOverall conclusion from a pharmacogenomics perspective:\n- In Chilean advanced CRC patients, common variants in TYMS, DPYD, GSTP1, TYMP, MTHFR, ERCC2 and ABCB1 significantly modulate the pattern and severity of 5\u2011FU/oxaliplatin\u2011related toxicities, particularly neuropathy, hematologic toxicity, mucositis, skin events, and pain.\n- Two preliminary multigene models (for anemia and pain) achieved moderate predictive performance (AUC ~0.7\u20130.75), demonstrating the feasibility of integrating multiple pharmacogenetic markers into ADR risk prediction tools.\n- The work provides population\u2011specific evidence to inform future prospective studies and lays groundwork for genotype\u2011guided dose individualization strategies in Chile, but is not yet sufficient for routine clinical implementation.\n\nTitle:\"Genetic variants and clinical determinants affecting the response to 5-Fluorouracil-based treatment in Chilean patients with advanced colorectal cancer\"\n\npmid:\"40786508\"\n\npmcid:\"PMC12331468\"",

    "summary": "Study question and background:\nThe authors previously showed that HLA\u2011B*57:01 (HLA\u2011B*5701) strongly predicts abacavir hypersensitivity, with the signal mapping to the central MHC (the 57.1 ancestral haplotype). Here they use fine mapping and functional assays to (1) localize the causal locus within the 57.1 ancestral haplotype more precisely, and (2) explore immune mechanisms underlying abacavir hypersensitivity.\n\nDesign and population:\n- Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, 248 fully ascertained abacavir\u2011exposed patients.\n- 18 \u201cdefinite\u201d abacavir hypersensitivity cases (7.3\u20138% prevalence with strict criteria) vs 230 tolerant controls.\n- Retrospective cohort of the first 200 abacavir\u2011exposed individuals plus a prospective component (48 patients), in which individuals with known 57.1 markers were generally excluded from abacavir where possible.\n- Rigorous case definition combined: clinical features within 6 weeks of starting abacavir, clear temporal relation with drug cessation, exclusion of alternative causes, supplemented by epicutaneous abacavir patch testing and ex vivo cytokine assays.\n\nGenetic methods:\n- High\u2011resolution typing of MHC markers including HLA\u2011B*5701, C4A6, HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\u2013HLA\u2011DQ3, and dense SNP/microsatellite mapping across the central MHC between C4A6 and MEGT1.\n- Focus on recombinants of the 57.1 ancestral haplotype to pinpoint a susceptibility region.\n- Full\u2011length sequencing of the Hsp70 gene cluster (Hsp70.1, Hsp70.2, Hsp70\u2011Hom / HSPA1L) to identify haplotype\u2011specific variants.\n\nKey genetic findings:\n1. Strength of association of HLA\u2011B*5701:\n   - HLA\u2011B*5701 present in 17/18 hypersensitive vs 4/230 tolerant (94.4% vs 1.7%).\n   - OR \u2248 960, Pc < 10\u207b\u2075.\n   - In the retrospective cohort, PPV 78.9%, NPV 99.4% for abacavir hypersensitivity.\n\n2. Other 57.1 markers:\n   - C4A6: 14/18 cases vs 7/230 controls (77.8% vs 3.0%; OR \u2248 111).\n   - HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\u2013HLA\u2011DQ3: 14/18 vs 11/230 (OR \u2248 70).\n   - The full 57.1 haplotype (HLA\u2011B*5701, C4A6, HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\u2013HLA\u2011DQ3) occurred in 14/18 cases and 0/230 controls (OR \u2248 1,485).\n\n3. Fine mapping narrows susceptibility to the Hsp70 cluster:\n   - By analyzing recombinant 57.1 haplotypes in 18 cases and 12 tolerant carriers, the minimal shared region in hypersensitive patients was narrowed to a ~14\u2011kb segment encompassing the Hsp70 gene cluster.\n   - Hsp70.1 and Hsp70.2 coding sequences were identical between hypersensitive and tolerant 57.1 carriers \u2192 excluded as susceptibility genes.\n   - Within Hsp70\u2011Hom (HSPA1L), a single nonsynonymous variant, M493T (T\u2192C, rs2227956), defined the relevant 57.1 background.\n\n4. Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T association:\n   - Hsp70\u2011Hom 493T variant present in 17/18 hypersensitive vs 51/230 tolerant (94.4% vs 22.2%; OR \u2248 59.7; Pc < 10\u207b\u2075).\n   - Alone, this variant is frequent in tolerant individuals, so it is not sufficient by itself.\n   - Crucially, the *combination* HLA\u2011B*5701 + Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T occurred in 17/18 hypersensitive vs 1/230 tolerant (94.4% vs 0.43%; OR \u2248 3,893; Pc < 10\u207b\u2075).\n   - This significantly improves discrimination relative to HLA\u2011B*5701 alone (Fisher\u2019s exact P = 0.003).\n   - Linkage disequilibrium between HLA\u2011B*5701 and Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T was strong in this cohort (relative LD = 0.82, P < 10\u207b\u2075).\n\nFunctional immunology findings:\n1. Ex vivo TNF responses to abacavir:\n   - In a 4\u2011hour PBMC assay, monocyte intracellular TNF accumulation increased markedly upon abacavir stimulation in hypersensitive patients (median 13.4\u2011fold increase, n = 8) but not in tolerant controls (median 8.9\u2011fold *decrease*, n = 9; P = 0.008).\n   - Hypersensitivity was also supported by positive epicutaneous patch tests in most clinically classified cases.\n   - Three initially suspected \u201chypersensitivity\u201d cases with alternative explanations (e.g., nevirapine) showed negative patch and TNF assays and were reclassified as tolerant.\n   - However, 2 definite hypersensitive patients had no increase in TNF in this short assay despite positive patch testing, underscoring that this functional assay is not sufficiently sensitive or specific for clinical decision\u2011making.\n\n2. CD8\u207a T\u2011cell dependence:\n   - In detailed whole\u2011blood culture experiments on two individuals who both carried HLA\u2011B*5701 + Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T:\n     - One had definite abacavir hypersensitivity; the other tolerated abacavir.\n   - Abacavir stimulation induced higher TNF secretion in the hypersensitive patient vs the tolerant carrier.\n   - Depletion of CD8\u207a T cells, but not CD4\u207a T cells, abrogated abacavir\u2011induced TNF production in the hypersensitive subject.\n   - These data strongly implicate a class I\u2013restricted, CD8\u207a T\u2011cell\u2013dependent mechanism involving monocytes as a TNF source.\n\nMechanistic interpretation:\n- The genetic mapping and LD structure support a two\u2011locus model:\n  1) HLA\u2011B*5701 provides the peptide\u2011presenting groove.\n  2) Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T modifies peptide binding/processing.\n- The M493 residue lies on the floor of the peptide\u2011binding domain of the homologous Hsc70; substituting threonine is predicted to alter substrate interaction, thus potentially changing the repertoire or stability of peptides delivered for HLA\u2011B*5701 presentation.\n- The authors hypothesize that abacavir (or a metabolite) haptenates endogenous peptides (\u201caltered self\u201d), with Hsp70\u2011Hom facilitating peptide loading onto HLA\u2011B*5701. These modified peptides could then trigger a vigorous CD8\u207a T\u2011cell response and inflammatory cytokine production (especially TNF).\n- This model is consistent with:\n  - Strong class I association (HLA\u2011B*5701),\n  - Hsp70\u2019s known role in peptide binding and cross\u2011presentation,\n  - CD8\u207a T\u2011cell dependence of TNF responses,\n  - Histological CD8\u207a infiltrates seen in abacavir patch tests in prior work.\n- The authors stress that additional, as\u2011yet unidentified factors are likely required, because they observed at least one individual carrying both HLA\u2011B*5701 and Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T who tolerated abacavir without detectable ex vivo TNF response.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics:\n- Prevalence of definite abacavir hypersensitivity in this fully ascertained cohort: ~8% (similar to other large series).\n- Prospective HLA\u2011B*5701 screening in the later part of the cohort prevented hypersensitivity among HLA\u2011B*5701\u2011negative individuals (0% incidence; 95% CI 0\u20137.5%).\n- Based on these data:\n  - Screening for HLA\u2011B*5701 alone would have reduced the prevalence of definite hypersensitivity from 8% to ~0.4% in this population.\n  - The trade\u2011off: ~1.6% of patients would be inappropriately denied abacavir (HLA\u2011B*5701 carriers who would not become hypersensitive).\n  - Adding Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T genotyping would further reduce the fraction of unnecessarily excluded patients to ~0.4%, because only the HLA\u2011B*5701 + M493T combination is highly enriched in cases relative to controls.\n  - With an 8.5% HLA\u2011B*5701 phenotype frequency, ~14 patients would need to be screened to prevent one case of hypersensitivity.\n- The study thus provides a rationale for pre\u2011prescription pharmacogenetic screening in abacavir therapy, particularly in populations of European ancestry where HLA\u2011B*5701 is common.\n\nLimitations and caveats:\n- Small number of hypersensitive cases (n=18) and rare informative recombinants limit mapping resolution; it remains possible that another functional variant tightly linked to Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T is causal.\n- Most data are from individuals of European descent; extrapolation to other ancestries requires caution given different LD structures and allele frequencies.\n- Functional assays (TNF readouts) lack sufficient sensitivity to guide clinical rechallenge decisions.\n\nOverall conclusions:\n- HLA\u2011B*5701 is a major genetic determinant of abacavir hypersensitivity.\n- Fine mapping localizes an additional susceptibility component to the Hsp70 gene cluster, specifically a haplotypic Hsp70\u2011Hom (HSPA1L) M493T variant, which in combination with HLA\u2011B*5701 confers extremely high risk (present in ~94% of definite cases and <1% of tolerant controls).\n- The pathogenesis appears to involve an HLA\u2011B*5701\u2011restricted, CD8\u207a T\u2011cell\u2013mediated immune response, potentially driven by abacavir\u2011haptenated peptides and modulated by Hsp70\u2011dependent antigen processing.\n- These findings underpin the now\u2011established practice of HLA\u2011B*5701 screening prior to abacavir and highlight the potential value of multi\u2011locus pharmacogenomic panels when haplotypic modifiers such as Hsp70\u2011Hom are important.\n",

Haplotype mapping within patients with allelic markers of the 57.1 ancestral haplotype suggests a susceptibility locus within the 14-kb Hsp70 gene cluster. HLA-B*5701 was present in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases compared with 1.7% of controls (odds ratio, 960; P < 0.00001). A haplotypic nonsynonymous polymorphism of Hsp70-Hom (HspA1L, resulting from the substitution of residue M493T in the peptide-binding subunit) was found in combination with HLA-B*5701 in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases and 0.4% of controls (odds ratio, 3,893; P < 0.00001).",
          "The only nucleotide substitution in the Hsp70-Hom gene identified in most of the abacavir-hypersensitive cases (94.4%) involvedaTtoC transition, which results in a change from methionine to threonine at amino acid residue 493 [hereafter referred to as M493T but also known as the Hsp70-Hom 2437CT allele (19) or rs2227956CT (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId=3305)]. The Hsp70-Hom M493T allele was assessed in all 248 patients of the cohort by using an allele-specific sequence-specific primer and/or the standard NcoI restriction fragment-length polymorphism assays. We observed that the Hsp70-Hom M493T allele, carried on the 57.1 AH, was detected in 94.4% of the hypersensitive group compared with 22.2% of tolerant controls (17 of 18 individuals vs. 51 of 230 individuals, OR = 59.7, Pc < 0.00001). However, in combination with HLA-B*5701, the Hsp70-Hom M493T allele was strongly associated with abacavir hypersensitivity (17 of 18 individuals vs. 1 of 230 individuals, OR = 3,893, Pc < 0.00001) (Table 2).",
          "In conclusion, we have identified the HLA-B*5701 and Hsp70-Hom M493T alleles as highly predictive genetic markers of susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity. These findings have significant implications both in terms of the clinical management of abacavir-exposed HIV-infected patients and the elucidation of basic pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this and other idiosyncratic drug hypersensitivity reactions."

similar in the total series.\n  - Combined clinical analysis: OR 8.33 (95% CI 3.59\u201319.36), P=8.0\u00d710\u207b\u2077.\n- SJS/TEN (n=12):\n  - HLA-A*3101 present in 5/12 (42%) vs 10/257 (4%) controls.\n  - OR 25.93 (95% CI 4.93\u2013116.18), P=8.0\u00d710\u207b\u2075.\n- Pooled across all phenotypes (145 total hypersensitivity cases vs 257 tolerant controls):\n  - OR 9.12 (95% CI 4.03\u201320.65), P=1.0\u00d710\u207b\u2077.\n\nAllele frequency and clinical impact\n- HLA-A*3101 prevalence in Northern Europeans: approximately 2\u20135%.\n- Estimated baseline risk of clinically recognized carbamazepine hypersensitivity: ~5%.\n- Using pooled data for Europeans:\n  - Sensitivity of HLA-A*3101 for hypersensitivity: 26%.\n  - Specificity: 96%.\n  - Positive likelihood ratio: 6.74 (95% CI 3.51\u201313.00).\n  - Negative likelihood ratio: 0.77 (95% CI 0.67\u20130.84).\n- Translating to absolute risk:\n  - In carriers, risk increases from 5.0% to ~26.0% (\u22485-fold absolute risk increase).\n  - In noncarriers, risk decreases from 5.0% to ~3.8%.\n- Number needed to screen (NNS) to prevent one hypersensitivity case if carbamazepine is avoided in carriers:\n  - Using 5% prevalence: NNS ~83 in Europeans.\n  - Using 10% prevalence estimate from the SANAD trial: NNS ~39.\n\nContext versus HLA-B*1502\n- HLA-B*1502 is strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN in Han Chinese and other Asian populations but does not explain risk in Europeans and appears largely phenotype-specific for SJS/TEN.\n- In contrast, HLA-A*3101 in Europeans is associated with a broad clinical spectrum:\n  - Mild maculopapular rash,\n  - Hypersensitivity syndrome/DRESS-like presentations,\n  - Severe SJS/TEN.\n- HLA-A*3101 has also been implicated in carbamazepine hypersensitivity in Japanese and Han Chinese patients, suggesting a shared immunogenetic mechanism across ancestries, though allele frequency and test performance differ by population.\n\nPharmacogenomic implications\n- HLA-A*3101 is a clinically relevant marker for carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity in Europeans, though not as strongly predictive as HLA-B*5701 is for abacavir hypersensitivity.\n- Carriage of HLA-A*3101 substantially increases risk, but the allele is neither necessary nor sufficient for reaction; many carriers tolerate carbamazepine, and some noncarriers still develop hypersensitivity.\n- The test\u2019s high specificity means a positive result is informative (high post-test risk), while a negative result only modestly reduces risk.\n- The authors estimate that prospective HLA-A*3101 screening in Europeans could be clinically useful and potentially cost-effective, analogous (though not identical) to abacavir/HLA-B*5701 practice.\n- They suggest consideration of adding HLA-A*3101 risk information to the carbamazepine prescribing label and recommend further prospective studies and evaluation in additional ethnic groups.\n\nMechanistic considerations\n- Findings support a class I HLA-restricted, T cell\u2013mediated mechanism across multiple cutaneous phenotypes.\n- HLA-A*3101 may influence antigenic peptide presentation of carbamazepine or its metabolites, triggering drug-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses implicated in hypersensitivity syndromes and SJS/TEN.\n- There may be overlap in peptide-binding specificity between HLA-A*3101 and HLA-B*1502, but the causal HLA molecule and precise antigenic determinants remain to be definitively established.\n\nOverall conclusion\nHLA-A*3101 is a major genetic determinant of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in Europeans, spanning maculopapular exanthema, hypersensitivity/DRESS, and SJS/TEN. Pre-prescription HLA-A*3101 testing has the potential to identify a subgroup with markedly elevated risk (\u22481 in 4) and to modestly reduce risk in those testing negative, supporting the integration of this marker into carbamazepine pharmacogenomic risk stratification, especially in populations with similar HLA-A*3101 frequencies to Northern Europeans.",

    "summary": "Study aim and design:\nThis pharmacogenomic study investigated germline genetic risk factors\u2014both HLA and non\u2011HLA\u2014for hypersensitivity reactions specifically to PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (pegaspargase) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Unlike prior work that mixed native and PEGylated asparaginase, this analysis was restricted to protocols using pegaspargase as first\u2011line therapy and included racially/ancestrally diverse cohorts.\n\nCohorts and phenotype:\n\u2022 St. Jude Total XVI (TXVI, n=598)\n\u2022 COG AALL0232 (B\u2011ALL, n=2472)\n\u2022 COG AALL0434 (T\u2011ALL, n=1189)\n\nAll patients received upfront pegaspargase; hypersensitivity was defined as CTCAE grade \u22652. Reaction rates were 13.7% (TXVI), 15.2% (AALL0232), and 8.2% (AALL0434). Clinical covariates associated with risk included:\n\u2022 More intrathecal doses during induction \u2192 lower risk (TXVI; OR\u22480.73, P\u22486\u00d710\u207b\u2075)\n\u2022 Male sex \u2192 higher risk (AALL0232; OR\u22481.24, P=0.025)\nNo consistent ancestry effect on reaction rates was seen.\n\nGenotyping and analysis:\nGermline DNA was genotyped using Illumina or Affymetrix arrays; untyped SNPs were imputed, and HLA alleles were imputed with SNP2HLA (all cohorts) or inferred from WES using BWAkit (TXVI). Patients were stratified into ancestry groups (EA, AA, AMR, East/South Asian, Other) using genome\u2011wide data. GWAS and HLA association analyses were performed within each cohort, adjusted for ancestry and protocol\u2011specific covariates, then combined by meta\u2011analysis. Genome\u2011wide significance thresholds were: 5\u00d710\u207b\u2078 for SNPs; 5.2\u00d710\u207b\u2074 for HLA alleles; 4.8\u00d710\u207b\u2075 for HLA amino acid variants.\n\nKey HLA findings in European\u2011ancestry (EA) patients:\nIn EA patients (n=2168), a strong and consistent association was found between pegaspargase hypersensitivity and a class II HLA haplotype:\n\u2022 HLA\u2011DQB1*02:02 (top hit)\n  \u2013 P_meta = 3.8\u00d710\u207b\u2079, OR\u22482.1\n  \u2013 Significant in all three protocols\n\u2022 HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\n  \u2013 P_meta = 2.2\u00d710\u207b\u2075, OR\u22482.0\n\u2022 HLA\u2011DQA1*02:01\n  \u2013 P_meta = 2.7\u00d710\u207b\u2075, OR\u22482.0\n\nPhasing showed these three alleles constitute a common extended haplotype DRB1*07:01\u2013DQA1*02:01\u2013DQB1*02:02 in EAs. Nearly all DQB1*02:02 carriers also harbored the full haplotype.\n\nAt the amino\u2011acid level, glycine at position 135 of HLA\u2011DQB1 (which marks DQB1*02:02) was the top association (P_meta = 3.8\u00d710\u207b\u2079, OR\u22482.1), reinforcing DQB1 as the primary signal. In conditional models, the three alleles could not be distinguished statistically due to strong linkage disequilibrium, but several lines of evidence (top P values, amino\u2011acid marker) support DQB1*02:02 as the key driver, with DRB1*07:01 conferring high risk primarily when co\u2011inherited with DQB1*02:02.\n\nImportantly, this is the same HLA class II haplotype previously associated with hypersensitivity to native E. coli asparaginase (ASNase), indicating a shared immunogenetic predisposition despite different dominant antibody targets (PEG versus asparaginase protein).\n\nGenome\u2011wide SNP associations in EAs:\nIn EA\u2011restricted GWAS, all genome\u2011wide significant SNPs mapped to the HLA class II region:\n\u2022 Top SNP: rs1694129 (5\u2032 of HLA\u2011DQB1)\n  \u2013 P_meta = 1.1\u00d710\u207b\u2078, OR\u22482.0\n  \u2013 Strong LD with HLA\u2011DQB1*02:02 in EAs (r\u00b2=0.96)\nAfter adjusting for HLA\u2011DQB1*02:02 or DRB1*07:01, no SNP remained genome\u2011wide significant, indicating that the EA signal is largely captured by this HLA haplotype.\n\nHLA and SNP associations in non\u2011European ancestries:\nDirect HLA calls from WES in non\u2011EA TXVI patients did not show significant replication of the high\u2011risk EA alleles, likely reflecting smaller sample size and differing LD patterns. When HLA was imputed (with acknowledged lower accuracy), DRB1*07:01, DQA1*02:01, and DQB1*02:02 showed nominal associations in non\u2011EAs (P_meta\u22480.01\u20130.04, OR\u22481.8\u20132.1), suggesting some shared risk but with reduced effect or tagging.\n\nUsing SNP\u2011based GWAS in non\u2011EAs (n=1607), distinct non\u2011HLA signals emerged:\n\u2022 ARHGAP28 locus (5\u2032 UTR variant rs9958628)\n  \u2013 Non\u2011EA meta\u2011analysis: P_meta = 8.9\u00d710\u207b\u2079, OR\u22483.7 (genome\u2011wide significant)\n  \u2013 All\u2011ancestry meta\u2011analysis: top non\u2011HLA signal (P_meta = 1.2\u00d710\u207b\u2077, OR\u22483.0)\n  \u2013 Strongest in African\u2011ancestry (AA) patients; not significant in EAs/AMRs (likely very low MAF in those groups)\n\u2022 GPBP1 downstream variants (rs79377225, rs11739459)\n  \u2013 Non\u2011EA meta\u2011analysis: P\u22482.5\u00d710\u207b\u2078 and 2.7\u00d710\u207b\u2078 (OR\u22482.5\u20132.7)\n  \u2013 Retained genome\u2011wide significance in trans\u2011ancestry meta\u2011analysis.\n\nSome HLA\u2011DRA region SNPs also associated with risk in non\u2011EAs (esp. AMR) at sub\u2013genome\u2011wide levels, but there was considerable ancestry\u2011specific variation in the exact HLA variants. Overall, HLA class II SNPs contributed less strongly in AAs than in EAs, and HLA tagging patterns differed by ancestry.\n\nFunctional and mechanistic context:\n\u2022 The repeated identification of DRB1*07:01\u2013DQA1*02:01\u2013DQB1*02:02 across independent cohorts and different asparaginase formulations suggests these HLA molecules present asparaginase\u2011 or PEG\u2011related antigens (or complexes) that drive T\u2011cell\u2013dependent IgE/IgG responses.\n\u2022 ARHGAP28 encodes a Rho GTPase\u2011activating protein. Variants in this locus have previously been associated with poor response to inhaled corticosteroids in asthma, particularly in non\u2011EA children, pointing to a broader role in immune/inflammatory regulation.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics:\n\u2022 In EA pediatric ALL patients, carriage of the DRB1*07:01\u2013DQA1*02:01\u2013DQB1*02:02 haplotype roughly doubles risk of clinically significant pegaspargase hypersensitivity (grade \u22652). This same haplotype also predicts hypersensitivity to native ASNase, so these alleles can be considered shared pharmacogenetic risk markers for the entire E. coli asparaginase/pegaspargase class.\n\u2022 Tagging SNPs such as rs1694129 (near HLA\u2011DQB1) or the previously reported rs28383172/rs7775228 pair can serve as surrogates for this haplotype in EAs, which may be useful in settings without high\u2011resolution HLA typing.\n\u2022 In non\u2011EA patients, strong non\u2011HLA susceptibility at ARHGAP28 and GPBP1 highlights that genetic architecture of pegaspargase allergy is ancestry\u2011specific. HLA associations observed in EAs only partly extend into non\u2011EA groups, and imputation accuracy is more limited.\n\u2022 These data support future development of ancestry\u2011informed pharmacogenomic risk models for pegaspargase hypersensitivity. Clinically, such models could be used to:\n  \u2013 Identify high\u2011risk patients for closer monitoring, altered asparaginase schedule, or early switch to Erwinia\u2011derived products.\n  \u2013 Guide mechanistic studies into PEG\u2011 or protein\u2011specific T\u2011cell epitopes and into ARHGAP28\u2011mediated immune pathways.\n\nLimitations:\n\u2022 No fully independent replication cohort; conclusions rely on meta\u2011analysis across three protocols.\n\u2022 HLA imputation in non\u2011EAs is less accurate and sample sizes in non\u2011EA strata (especially AA) are modest, limiting power and precision.\n\u2022 Treatment differences across protocols (IT therapy, glucocorticoids, nelarabine, methotrexate regimens) could confound comparability of reaction rates.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nPegaspargase hypersensitivity in pediatric ALL is strongly associated, in European\u2011ancestry patients, with the HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\u2013DQA1*02:01\u2013DQB1*02:02 haplotype previously linked to native asparaginase allergy, indicating a shared class II HLA\u2011restricted immune mechanism. In non\u2011European ancestries, additional genome\u2011wide significant risk loci at ARHGAP28 (and near GPBP1) point to distinct, ancestry\u2011specific non\u2011HLA contributions. These findings refine the pharmacogenomic landscape of asparaginase/pegaspargase hypersensitivity and motivate ancestry\u2011tailored genetic risk prediction and mechanistic follow\u2011up studies.\n",

    "summary": "Study question and rationale:\nTicagrelor is almost entirely cleared by CYP3A4. Clinical bleeding and dyspnea correlate with ticagrelor (parent) exposure rather than its active metabolite AR\u2011C124910XX. CYP3A4 is highly polymorphic, and several alleles are enriched in the Chinese Han population, but their impact on ticagrelor metabolism has not been systematically characterized. This in\u2011vitro study functionally evaluates 22 CYP3A4 protein variants (plus the Chinese reference allele CYP3A4*1G, defined here functionally as wild-type *1) using ticagrelor as substrate.\n\nMethods:\n\u2022 Recombinant CYP3A4 enzymes: 22 allelic variants expressed in baculovirus\u2011infected insect cells, co\u2011incubated with cytochrome b5.\n\u2022 Ticagrelor concentrations: 1\u201350 \u00b5M, 30\u2011min incubations at 37 \u00b0C.\n\u2022 Product measured: AR\u2011C124910XX by validated UHPLC\u2013MS/MS (LLOQ 5 nM; good linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery, and negligible matrix effect).\n\u2022 Kinetic analysis: Michaelis\u2013Menten modeling (GraphPad Prism) to derive Vmax, Km, and intrinsic clearance (CLint = Vmax/Km). Relative clearance expressed as % of CYP3A4*1.\n\nKey kinetic findings (vs CYP3A4*1):\nWild-type (*1):\n\u2022 Vmax 1,743 pmol/min/nmol; Km 2.18 \u00b5M; CLint 800 \u00b5L/min/nmol (100%).\n\n1) Markedly increased intrinsic clearance (putative \u201cextensive/ultra-rapid\u201d ticagrelor metabolizers):\n\u2022 *11 (T363M): CLint 2,123 \u00b5L/min/nmol (264.7%).\n\u2022 *18 (L293P, common in Han Chinese): CLint 978 \u00b5L/min/nmol (122.5%).\n\u2022 *33 (A370S): CLint 940 \u00b5L/min/nmol (117.8%).\n\nThese alleles show substantially faster in\u2011vitro formation of AR\u2011C124910XX from ticagrelor. Clinically, carriers may have lower ticagrelor exposure and potentially attenuated risk of ticagrelor\u2011driven adverse events, but also a risk of underexposure if doses are not optimized.\n\n2) Near-normal intrinsic clearance (similar to *1 for ticagrelor):\n\u2022 *10 (D174H): CLint 889.7 \u00b5L/min/nmol (111.4%).\n\u2022 *23 (R162W): CLint 742.9 \u00b5L/min/nmol (92.8%).\n\u2022 *32 (I335T): CLint 833.1 \u00b5L/min/nmol (103.8%).\n\u2022 *34 (I427V): CLint 893.2 \u00b5L/min/nmol (111.9%).\n\nThese variants likely do not meaningfully alter ticagrelor metabolism relative to wild-type.\n\n3) Decreased intrinsic clearance (putative \u201cpoor to intermediate\u201d ticagrelor metabolizers):\nFourteen alleles had significantly reduced CLint (1.48\u201375.11% of wild-type):\n\u2022 Severely reduced activity:\n  \u2013 *24 (Q200H): CLint 11.9 \u00b5L/min/nmol (1.48% of *1); essentially minimal activity.\n  \u2013 *17 (F189S): CLint 37.8 \u00b5L/min/nmol (4.72%).\n\n\u2022 Moderately reduced activity:\n  \u2013 *2 (S222P): CLint 203.6 (25.5%).\n  \u2013 *14 (L15P): 229.8 (28.7%).\n  \u2013 *3 (M445T): 280.2 (35.0%).\n  \u2013 *16 (T185S): 360.1 (45.1%).\n  \u2013 *5 (P218R): 369.9 (46.3%).\n  \u2013 *28 (L22V): 425.1 (53.3%).\n  \u2013 *4 (I118V): 551.9 (68.8%).\n  \u2013 *19 (P467S): 539.7 (67.4%).\n  \u2013 *29 (F113I): 531.3 (66.5%).\n  \u2013 *15 (R162Q): 573.6 (71.8%).\n  \u2013 *9 (V170I): 599.7 (75.0%).\n  \u2013 *31 (H324Q): 601.2 (75.1%).\n\nMechanistically, most variants showed higher Km (reduced affinity) coupled with altered Vmax; the net effect is lower CLint. Carriers are expected to have slower ticagrelor clearance, higher plasma levels, and thus higher risk of concentration\u2011dependent adverse events (bleeding and ticagrelor\u2011associated dyspnea), analogous to the clinically characterized loss\u2011of\u2011function allele CYP3A4*22.\n\n4) No/weak activity:\n\u2022 *30 (R130STOP): no detectable activity for ticagrelor; kinetics not determined. This nonsense variant truncates the protein before the catalytic domain and likely represents a true loss\u2011of\u2011function allele.\n\nInterpretation and pharmacogenomic/clinical implications:\n\u2022 Ticagrelor is predominantly (\u224895%) cleared by CYP3A4, and clinical adverse reactions correlate with parent\u2011drug concentration, not with AR\u2011C124910XX.\n\u2022 CYP3A4 polymorphisms create a wide spectrum of in\u2011vitro ticagrelor metabolic capacities, from near-null (e.g., *24, *17, *30) to more than 2\u2011fold higher than wild-type (*11).\n\u2022 Given that therapeutic ticagrelor Cmax (~1 \u00b5M) is below the measured Km for all variants, in\u2011vivo metabolism is expected to behave in a first\u2011order, linear fashion; therefore, CLint differences are likely to translate fairly directly into differences in systemic exposure.\n\u2022 Poor-metabolizer genotypes (severely or moderately reduced activity alleles, especially *17, *24, and possibly *30 in compound heterozygotes) are expected to have higher ticagrelor exposure at standard doses and therefore heightened risk of bleeding and dyspnea. Dose reduction or therapeutic drug monitoring might be warranted in such carriers, particularly in the Chinese Han population where some of these alleles are enriched.\n\u2022 High-activity variants (*11, *18, *33) could predispose to lower ticagrelor levels and potentially lower risk of concentration\u2011dependent toxicity, but may necessitate attention to ensure adequate antiplatelet effect, especially in high\u2011risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients.\n\u2022 The work is entirely in vitro; no direct clinical pharmacokinetic or outcome data are provided for these alleles with ticagrelor. The authors emphasize that genotype\u2013phenotype extrapolation should be confirmed in vivo.\n\nStrengths and limitations:\nStrengths:\n\u2022 Systematic functional evaluation of a large panel of CYP3A4 alleles, including several Chinese\u2011specific or newly identified variants, using a validated UHPLC\u2013MS/MS assay.\n\u2022 Quantitative kinetic characterization (Vmax, Km, CLint) for each allele, enabling direct comparison and use in future physiologically based PK modeling.\n\nLimitations:\n\u2022 In-vitro recombinant system may not recapitulate full hepatic and intestinal expression, cofactor availability, or regulatory influences.\n\u2022 Allele frequencies and genotype combinations (e.g., compound heterozygotes) are not integrated into population\u2011level predictions.\n\u2022 No direct clinical PK/PD or bleeding outcome data tied to these specific alleles; thus, all clinical implications remain inferential.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nCYP3A4 genetic polymorphisms cause pronounced, allele\u2011specific differences in ticagrelor metabolism in vitro in a panel of 22 variants relevant to the Chinese Han population. Most variants deviate from wild-type activity, with several functioning as marked loss\u2011of\u2011function alleles and others as gain\u2011of\u2011function variants. Given the tight link between ticagrelor exposure and adverse events, CYP3A4 genotyping has potential utility for predicting ticagrelor pharmacokinetics, optimizing dosing, and refining bleeding/dyspnea risk stratification, although dedicated clinical validation studies are needed before implementation in routine care.\n\nKey translational points for pharmacogenomics:\n\u2022 Candidate \u201cpoor metabolizer\u201d alleles for ticagrelor: *17, *24, and likely *30 (null), plus additional decreased\u2011function alleles (*2, *3, *4, *5, *9, *14, *15, *16, *19, *28, *29, *31).\n\u2022 Candidate \u201crapid/extensive\u201d alleles for ticagrelor: *11, *18, *33.\n\u2022 These data could be incorporated into PBPK models and ultimately into allele\u2011specific dosing or monitoring algorithms for ticagrelor, especially in East Asian populations where several of these alleles are prevalent.\n\n(Article type: in\u2011vitro functional pharmacogenomics study; population focus: Chinese Han CYP3A4 allele spectrum.)",

    "summary": "Purpose\nTo quantify how much rare DPYD variants contribute to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, and to evaluate whether next\u2011generation sequencing (NGS)\u2013based DPYD profiling could improve prediction of fluoropyrimidine toxicity beyond conventional testing for a few guideline variants.\n\nDesign and methods\n- Retrospective single\u2011center study of 2,972 adults scheduled for fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.\n- DPD phenotype was measured pre\u2011treatment using plasma uracil [U] and the dihydrouracil/uracil ratio ([UH2]/[U]) by UPLC\u2013MS/MS.\n  - Partial DPD deficiency: [UH2]/[U] \u2264 10; complete deficiency: [UH2]/[U] \u2264 1 (none observed).\n  - Alternative thresholds based on [U] alone (\u226516 \u00b5g/mL for partial deficiency, \u2265150 \u00b5g/mL for complete) were also assessed.\n- DPYD was sequenced by amplicon-based NGS (MiSeq) covering all exons and splice junctions; very rare/novel variants were Sanger-confirmed.\n- Variants were annotated with SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD; rare variants were defined as MAF <1% (very rare \u22640.1%).\n- Statistics: non-parametric tests comparing [UH2]/[U] across genotypes; enrichment analyses for variant classes in deficient vs normal phenotypes.\n\nKey cohort and phenotyping findings\n- 19.7% (580/2,972) of patients had partial DPD deficiency by [UH2]/[U] \u2264 10; no complete deficiency detected.\n- Using both [U] and [UH2]/[U] identified 21.1% (628/2,972) as DPD deficient, but concordance between the two markers at standard cut\u2011offs was low (only 114 patients overlapped):\n  - Many patients had low [UH2]/[U] but [U] <16 ng/mL, and vice versa.\n  - The data suggest currently recommended thresholds for [U] and [UH2]/[U] do not classify deficiency equivalently; [UH2]/[U] \u2264 10 labels more patients as partially deficient.\n\nGenetic findings\n- In DPD\u2011deficient group (n=580):\n  - 134 were DPYD wild-type; 446 carried \u22651 variant (208 with 1, 238 with >1), totaling 809 variants.\n  - 30 distinct variants: 7 common (MAF \u22651%), 23 rare/very rare/novel (MAF <1%); 13/23 rare variants predicted deleterious.\n  - Variant types: 77% missense, 1 nonsense, 1 indel, 2 canonical splice, 3 synonymous.\n- In phenotypically normal group (n=2,392):\n  - 623 wild-type; 1,769 with variants (831 with 1, 938 with >1), totaling 3,183 variants.\n  - 58 distinct variants: 7 common, 51 rare/very rare/novel; 18/51 rare variants predicted deleterious.\n  - Variant types: 55% missense, 2 nonsense, 2 indels, 6 canonical splice, 17 synonymous, 1 UTR.\n- All rare variants were heterozygous. Assumed predominantly European ancestry.\n\nAssociation of guideline DPYD variants with DPD activity\n- Classic high-risk variants (all heterozygous in this cohort):\n  - c.1905+1G>A (*DPYD*2A, rs3918290; splice donor).\n  - c.1679T>G (*DPYD*13, rs55886062; Ile560Ser).\n  - c.2846A>T (rs67376798; Asp949Val).\n- Each showed a strong, highly significant reduction in [UH2]/[U] compared with noncarriers, confirming their major functional impact and supporting existing CPIC/EMA guideline recommendations for genotype\u2011guided dose reduction.\n\nAssociation of common DPYD variants\nSeven common variants (MAF \u22651%) were evaluated; three showed modest but significant associations with lower [UH2]/[U]:\n- c.1236G>A (rs56038477; p.Glu412Glu; hapB3 component) \u2013 consistent with prior evidence of partial DPD deficiency.\n- c.496A>G (rs2297595; p.Met166Val).\n- c.2194G>A (rs1801160; *DPYD*6; p.Val732Ile).\nThe effect sizes on DPD activity were much smaller than for *2A, *13 and c.2846A>T, raising questions about their standalone clinical utility for dose adjustment.\n\nBurden and impact of rare/very rare DPYD variants\n- Rare variants (MAF <1%) were significantly enriched in partially DPD-deficient patients compared to those with normal activity:\n  - Any rare variant: 9.3% in deficient vs 3.2% in normal; p < 1\u00d710\u207b\u2075.\n  - After excluding *2A, *13 and c.2846A>T: 4.5% vs 2.6%; p < 0.03.\n- When restricting to rare variants predicted deleterious by CADD >15 and excluding the classic high\u2011risk alleles:\n  - 4.2% of deficient vs 1.6% of normal patients carried such variants (p < 0.001).\n- These findings indicate that:\n  - A sizable fraction of patients with low DPD activity carry rare, likely functional DPYD alleles that are not captured by standard 4\u2011variant clinical panels.\n  - Rare variants contribute measurably to interindividual variability in DPD activity and thus to fluoropyrimidine toxicity risk.\n\nInterpretation and implications for pharmacogenomics\n- Phenotyping vs genotyping:\n  - Uracil-based phenotyping ([U], [UH2]/[U]) shows substantial methodological and threshold-related variability and imperfect concordance.\n  - Genotype-based prediction of DPD activity with established high\u2011risk DPYD variants is robust and clinically validated; however, it misses many functionally impaired individuals.\n- Rare-variant contribution:\n  - Consistent with broader pharmacogenomic data showing that >90% of pharmacogene variation is rare, this study demonstrates that rare DPYD variants are significantly enriched in phenotypic DPD deficiency.\n  - Approximately one half of the rare variants detected had in silico evidence of deleteriousness (high CADD, damaging SIFT/PolyPhen), and these clustered more frequently in patients with low [UH2]/[U].\n- Clinical implication:\n  - Limiting testing to the four guideline variants (*2A, *13, c.2846A>T, hapB3) improves safety but leaves a non-trivial residual risk because additional rare loss\u2011of\u2011function or deleterious missense alleles remain undetected.\n  - Comprehensive DPYD sequencing (exons + splice sites) integrated with an interpretation framework (e.g., CADD >15 plus functional data as they accumulate) would better stratify risk and more accurately predict DPD phenotype.\n  - Such NGS-based genotyping could be combined with phenotyping to create a more sensitive and specific pre\u2011treatment screen for fluoropyrimidine dose individualization.\n\nLimitations\n- No direct toxicity data: the study links DPYD variation to a biochemical/phenotypic marker ([UH2]/[U]) but not to observed clinical fluoropyrimidine toxicity or outcomes.\n- Single-center, mostly European cohort; ancestry-specific variant spectra and effect sizes may differ in non\u2011European populations.\n- Functional effects of most rare variants were inferred from in silico tools, not from in vitro enzyme assays.\n\nAuthors\u2019 conclusions\n- Rare and very rare DPYD variants substantially contribute to interindividual variability in DPD enzyme activity.\n- Current limited DPYD genotyping panels are insufficient to identify all patients at high risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity.\n- The authors advocate incorporating NGS-based comprehensive DPYD sequencing\u2014including rare variants\u2014into routine pre\u2011emptive pharmacogenetic testing, ideally in combination with phenotyping, to optimize safety of 5\u2011FU and capecitabine without compromising efficacy.\n\nFor practice and guideline development\n- Supports ongoing movement from \u201c4-variant DPYD panels\u201d toward broader sequencing-based pharmacogenomics for fluoropyrimidines.\n- Suggests that rare-variant burden or curated variant lists (leveraging resources like PharmVar/PharmGKB) may need to be integrated into future CPIC/EMA recommendations.\n- Highlights the need for prospective, toxicity-linked studies to validate which specific rare variants (or aggregate burden scores) warrant clinical dose modification.\n",

    "summary": "Objective\nTo evaluate how common pharmacokinetic variants in SLCO1B1, ABCG2 and CYP2C9 affect real\u2011world statin intolerance, using nationwide prescription and laboratory data linked to biobank genotypes, and to test whether a register\u2011based \u201cstatin switch\u201d phenotype is a useful proxy for intolerance.\n\nStudy design and population\n- Register-based cohort from Helsinki Biobank linked to Finnish national prescription and clinical chemistry registries.\n- 2,042 incident statin users with consent and DNA (out of 2,242 identified; exclusions mainly for missing genotypes, combination products, and a reimbursement-policy\u2013driven switching period).\n- Index statins: simvastatin (n=916), atorvastatin (n=780), rosuvastatin (n=184), fluvastatin (n=70), pravastatin (n=92).\n\nGenetics\n- SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (c.521T>C; Val174Ala).\n- ABCG2 rs2231142 (c.421C>A; Gln141Lys).\n- CYP2C9 rs1799853 (*2), rs1057910 (*3); used to classify CYP2C9 normal, intermediate, poor metabolizers.\n- Genotype frequencies in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium and similar to Finnish reference data.\n\nPhenotyping of statin intolerance\nTwo operational phenotypes, defined per index statin:\n1) Primary: \u201cstatin switch\u201d \u2013 change from index statin to a different statin (ATC code change; brand changes ignored). Event date = last purchase of index statin.\n2) Secondary: \u201cstatin switch + CK\u201d \u2013 statin switch plus any creatine kinase (CK) measurement from 30 days before to 90 days after the switch (value not required to be elevated), intended to enrich for suspected myopathy.\n- Follow-up from first index statin purchase until 365 days without any statin purchase, death, or 31 Dec 2016.\n- Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for daily statin dose (categorical). Genotypes modeled additively; dose categories merged if <10 individuals.\n\nKey results by statin\n\nSimvastatin (n=916; median follow-up 532 days)\n- Intolerance events: 232 statin switchers; 22 switchers with qualifying CK measurement.\n- SLCO1B1 c.521C/C vs T/T:\n  - Statin switch: HR 1.88 (95% CI 1.08\u20133.25; P=0.025).\n  - Statin switch + CK: HR 5.44 (95% CI 1.49\u201319.9; P=0.011).\n- Simvastatin dose \u226540 mg vs 10 mg increased switch risk: HR 1.48 (95% CI 1.03\u20132.12; P=0.035).\n- Heterozygotes (T/C) showed no clear increase with the primary switch phenotype.\n- This robustly replicates the established association of SLCO1B1*5 (521C) with simvastatin intolerance in real-world data and validates the switch-based phenotype.\n\nAtorvastatin (n=780; median follow-up 556.5 days)\n- Intolerance events: 128 switchers; 18 switchers + CK.\n- No statistically significant associations for:\n  - SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (including C/C) with either phenotype.\n  - ABCG2 c.421C>A.\n  - Combined \u201crisk allele count\u201d (SLCO1B1 + ABCG2).\n  - Atorvastatin dose.\n- Point estimates for SLCO1B1 C\u2011allele carriers in the switch + CK phenotype were in the same direction and magnitude as prior reports, but underpowered to reach significance, likely because most patients were on low\u2013moderate doses (10\u201320 mg, few at 80 mg).\n\nRosuvastatin (n=184; median follow-up 92.5 days)\n- Intolerance events: 32 switchers; CK-based phenotype not analyzed (too few events).\n- Dose: 10 mg vs 5 mg associated with increased switching (HR 3.55; 95% CI 1.07\u201311.8; P=0.038), consistent with dose-dependent intolerance.\n- No significant association with:\n  - SLCO1B1 c.521T>C.\n  - ABCG2 c.421C>A.\n  - Combined risk allele count.\n- Short follow-up and small sample limited power; findings are consistent with previous rosuvastatin trial data that did not show SLCO1B1\u2013myalgia association.\n\nFluvastatin (n=70)\n- Intolerance events: 31 switchers.\n- No statistically significant associations for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, CYP2C9, or combined risk alleles.\n- Some non-significant trends:\n  - ABCG2 variant and CYP2C9 reduced function and higher combined risk allele count (2\u20134 alleles) showed HRs >1 (up to ~1.9) but with wide CIs crossing 1, suggesting possible effect consistent with prior transplant data but underpowered here.\n\nPravastatin (n=92; median follow-up >2 years)\n- Intolerance events: 29 switchers.\n- SLCO1B1 c.521T/C or C/C vs T/T:\n  - Statin switch: HR 2.11 (95% CI 1.01\u20134.39; P=0.047).\n- Doses were 20\u201340 mg (40 mg is the European maximum).\n- No CK-based phenotype analyzed for pravastatin (too few events).\n- This is notable because prior pravastatin safety data (short 16-week trial) did not show such an association; longer follow-up here may better capture late-onset intolerance.\n\nABCG2 and CYP2C9 overall\n- ABCG2 c.421C>A:\n  - No clear association with intolerance to atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, or pravastatin in this cohort.\n  - Pharmacokinetic effects seen in prior work did not translate into statistically robust clinical intolerance signals, likely due to limited power.\n- CYP2C9 (*2, *3):\n  - For fluvastatin, intermediate/poor metabolizers (vs normal) showed a non\u2011significant HR 1.36 for switching; not definitive.\n  - No strong signals of genotype\u2013intolerance association in this dataset.\n\nMethodological and conceptual points\n- Phenotype choice: The authors intentionally favored \u201cswitching\u201d (rather than discontinuation or dose reduction) as a marker of intolerance, based on preliminary analyses showing better agreement with SLCO1B1\u2013simvastatin associations and to minimize non\u2013intolerance reasons for changes.\n- The secondary \u201cswitch + CK\u201d phenotype enriched for suspected muscle toxicity (CK measured around the time of switch), capturing both CK-elevated myopathy and myalgias that prompt CK testing even if results are normal.\n- Administrative confounding: policy-driven switches from atorvastatin/rosuvastatin around 2006\u20132007 (due to reimbursement rules) were excluded to avoid bias.\n- Limitations:\n  - Epidemiologic, retrospective design; cannot prove causality.\n  - No direct clinical symptom data or CK values; only timing of CK testing.\n  - Small numbers for rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin limit precision.\n  - Single-country, mainly Finnish, so genotype frequencies and practice patterns may differ elsewhere.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics\n1) Simvastatin\n   - Findings strongly reinforce current CPIC recommendations: SLCO1B1 c.521C/C substantially increases real-world simvastatin intolerance, especially at higher doses.\n   - In practice, SLCO1B1 poor-function genotypes should prompt use of a lower-risk statin (e.g., pravastatin, rosuvastatin) or lower simvastatin doses with careful monitoring.\n\n2) Pravastatin\n   - SLCO1B1 c.521T>C also increases risk of pravastatin switching (HR ~2.1), suggesting that even \u201chydrophilic, non\u2013CYP\u2011metabolized\u201d pravastatin is not completely exempt from OATP1B1-related intolerance.\n   - Supports the inclusion of pravastatin in SLCO1B1-based statin choice algorithms, especially at 20\u201340 mg doses.\n\n3) Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin, Fluvastatin\n   - No statistically significant pharmacogenetic signals in this single cohort, but point estimates are directionally compatible with prior evidence for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.\n   - Data are valuable for meta-analyses and guideline refinement; current CPIC recommendations (cautious dosing or alternative statin in high SLCO1B1/ABCG2 risk genotypes, particularly at high doses) remain biologically plausible even if not conclusively supported here.\n\n4) Phenotyping strategy for real-world PGx\n   - The study demonstrates that combining prescription data (switches) with laboratory data (CK testing) is a feasible way to create scalable, registry-based pharmacogenomic phenotypes in the absence of structured clinical myopathy documentation.\n\nOverall conclusion\n- SLCO1B1 c.521T>C is clearly associated with increased real-world switching from simvastatin and pravastatin to other statins, supporting its role as a key determinant of statin intolerance beyond simvastatin alone.\n- No definitive additional associations were demonstrated for ABCG2 or CYP2C9 variants, or for atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin intolerance, largely due to power and dose limitations.\n- The register-based \u201cswitch\u201d and \u201cswitch + CK\u201d phenotypes appear valid and scalable for future large pharmacogenomic studies and can inform ongoing refinement of statin PGx prescribing guidelines.\n",

    "summary": "Study design and population:\n- Retrospective pharmacogenomic study in 250 Thai adults on long\u2011term warfarin with stable weekly doses (SWDs) and INRs 2.0\u20133.0.\n- Collected demographic/clinical data (age, BMI, indication, co-medications, smoking) and genotyped four SNPs: VKORC1 \u22121639G>A, CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910), CYP4F2 rs2108622, and UGT1A1 rs887829.\n\nKey findings \u2013 genetic factors:\n- VKORC1 \u22121639G>A was the strongest determinant of dose:\n  - AA and GA genotypes required ~50% and ~28% lower SWDs than GG.\n  - In multivariable modeling, VKORC1 explained 26.2% of dose variance (22.5% AA, 3.7% GA).\n- CYP2C9*3 had a moderate effect:\n  - *1/*3 and *3/*3 genotypes required ~34% and ~65% lower SWDs than *1/*1.\n  - Accounted for ~6.0% of variability (3.3% *3/*3, 2.7% *1/*3), consistent with its lower allele frequency in Asians.\n- CYP4F2 rs2108622 had a modest, dose\u2011increasing effect:\n  - TT genotype associated with +4.1 mg/week vs CC in multivariable analysis.\n  - Contributed 1.2% to dose variance.\n- UGT1A1 rs887829 had no detectable impact on warfarin dose in this Thai cohort, despite prior positive reports in Koreans and Brazilians.\n\nKey findings \u2013 non\u2011genetic factors:\n- Age: strong negative relationship with dose (\u22120.25 mg/week per year; r = \u22120.33). Patients \u226560 years required significantly lower doses than those 20\u201339.\n- BMI: positive relationship with dose (+0.345 mg/week per BMI unit). Class I\u2013II obesity required ~25% higher doses than normal BMI.\n- Co\u2011medications:\n  - Amiodarone: \u22127.2 mg/week (3.0% of variance), consistent with inhibition of warfarin metabolism.\n  - Antiplatelet drugs (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor): \u22123.4 mg/week (1.0% of variance).\n- Smoking: Current smokers required ~4.0 mg/week higher doses (0.8% of variance), likely via CYP1A2 induction and increased warfarin clearance.\n- Sex, height, and UGT1A1 genotype were not significant predictors.\n\nExplained variability and model performance:\n- Stepwise multiple linear regression including VKORC1, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2 rs2108622, age, BMI, amiodarone use, antiplatelet use, and current smoking explained 51.3% of variability in stable warfarin dose.\n- Approximate contributions to R\u00b2:\n  - VKORC1 \u22121639G>A: 26.2%\n  - Age: 10.8%\n  - CYP2C9*3: 6.0%\n  - Amiodarone: 3.0%\n  - BMI: 2.3%\n  - CYP4F2 rs2108622 (TT): 1.2%\n  - Antiplatelets: 1.0%\n  - Smoking: 0.8%\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- In Thai patients, VKORC1 \u22121639G>A and CYP2C9*3 are the primary pharmacogenomic drivers of warfarin dose, with CYP4F2 rs2108622 exerting a smaller, dose\u2011increasing effect.\n- UGT1A1 rs887829 does not appear to be clinically useful for warfarin dose prediction in this population, despite mechanistic plausibility and prior positive studies in other ethnic groups.\n- Clinical factors\u2014especially age, BMI, and co\u2011treatment with amiodarone or antiplatelet agents, plus smoking status\u2014meaningfully modify warfarin requirements and should be considered alongside genotype.\n- A combined algorithm incorporating VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2 plus age, BMI, and key co\u2011medications can explain about half of warfarin dose variability in Thais; diet and other unmeasured factors likely account for much of the remainder.\n- Findings support population\u2011specific warfarin pharmacogenetic dosing approaches in Southeast Asians, emphasizing VKORC1/CYP2C9/CYP4F2 together with age and BMI, while not prioritizing UGT1A1 genotyping for warfarin.\n\nLimitations noted by authors:\n- Retrospective design; vitamin K intake and some other confounders were not controlled.\n- Relatively small numbers for some genotypes (e.g., CYP2C9*3/*3, UGT1A1 TT), limiting precision of those estimates.\n- Results may not generalize beyond Thai patients with similar clinical characteristics.\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- In Thai patients, stable warfarin dose is jointly determined by VKORC1 \u22121639G>A, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2 rs2108622 and by age, BMI, amiodarone, antiplatelet use, and smoking status, which together account for 51.3% of inter\u2011individual dose variability. UGT1A1 rs887829 is not a meaningful predictor in this population.\n\nThese data support using a warfarin dosing algorithm tailored to Thais that includes VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2 and key clinical covariates for more accurate initial and maintenance dose prediction, with a call for prospective studies to test clinical utility.\n",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\n- Case\u2013control pharmacogenomic study in Iraqi rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.\n- 100 RA patients on anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 therapy (etanercept or infliximab) and 100 age/sex-matched apparently healthy controls.\n- Investigated whether NLRP3 rs4612666 (C>T) and CARD8 rs2043211 (A>T) polymorphisms influence: (1) RA susceptibility, (2) disease activity, (3) serum TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2, and (4) clinical response to TNF\u2011\u03b1 inhibitors.\n\nMethods (PGx\u2011relevant):\n- Genotyping: SYBR Green-based real\u2011time PCR allelic discrimination (tri\u2011plex) for NLRP3 rs4612666 and CARD8 rs2043211.\n- Phenotyping/clinical data: DAS\u201128, EULAR-based classification into responders vs non\u2011responders after 3 months of etanercept or infliximab.\n- Biomarkers: serum TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 (sandwich ELISA). \n\nKey baseline/clinical findings:\n- RA patients had significantly higher mean serum TNF\u2011\u03b1 (7.84 vs 6.09 pg/mL; P = 0.0005) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (2.18 vs 1.21 pg/mL; P < 0.0001) than controls.\n- DAS\u201128 correlated positively with TNF\u2011\u03b1 (r\u00b2 = 0.45) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (r\u00b2 = 0.51), both P < 0.0001.\n- 66% of patients were responders and 34% non\u2011responders after 3 months; etanercept and infliximab had comparable efficacy.\n- Non\u2011responders had much higher cytokine levels (TNF\u2011\u03b1 \u2248 13.7 vs 4.8 pg/mL; IL\u20111\u03b2 \u2248 3.36 vs 1.57 pg/mL; both P < 0.0001).\n\nGenetic associations \u2013 disease susceptibility:\n- No significant difference in genotype or allele frequencies between RA cases and controls for either SNP:\n  - CARD8 rs2043211: genotype P = 0.17; allele P = 0.059, MAF patients 0.395 vs controls 0.305.\n  - NLRP3 rs4612666: genotype P = 0.08; allele P = 0.879, similar MAF (~0.32 vs 0.31).\n- Conclusion: In this Iraqi cohort, CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 are not major susceptibility loci for RA onset.\n\nGenotype\u2013phenotype associations within RA patients:\n1) Disease activity (DAS\u201128 and EULAR category)\n- CARD8 rs2043211:\n  - TT (variant homozygote) associated with significantly higher DAS\u201128 (mean \u2248 4.65 vs 3.51 for AA; P < 0.0001).\n  - Genotype distribution differed across disease activity categories (P = 0.033); TT concentrated in moderate/high disease activity; absent in remission/low activity.\n  - Recessive T\u2011allele model (AA vs AT+TT) associated with higher disease activity (P = 0.029) and higher DAS\u201128 (P = 0.003).\n\n- NLRP3 rs4612666:\n  - TT associated with higher DAS\u201128 (\u2248 4.72 vs 3.52 for CC; P < 0.0001).\n  - Genotype distribution also differed across activity categories (P = 0.008), with TT and CT enriched in moderate/high activity.\n  - Recessive T\u2011allele model (CC vs CT+TT) associated with higher disease activity (P = 0.002) and worse DAS\u201128 (P < 0.0001).\n\n2) Response to anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 therapy\n- Clear pharmacogenomic signal for both loci.\n\n- CARD8 rs2043211:\n  - Strong difference in genotype distribution between responders and non\u2011responders (P < 0.0001).\n  - TT genotype heavily enriched among non\u2011responders; AA strongly enriched among responders.\n  - Dominant \u201cT\u2011carrier\u201d model (AA+AT vs TT) and recessive \u201cT\u2011carrier\u201d model (AA vs AT+TT) both associated with poor response; ORs indicate T\u2011allele bearing genotypes predict lower likelihood of response (e.g., for recessive model, OR ~0.18 for response when comparing AA to AT+TT).\n\n- NLRP3 rs4612666:\n  - Similarly, genotype distribution differs strongly between responders and non\u2011responders (P < 0.0001).\n  - TT and CT genotypes are over\u2011represented among non\u2011responders; CC among responders.\n  - Dominant C\u2011allele model (CC+CT vs TT) associated with better response (P < 0.0001, OR ~0.04\u20130.13 vs recessive T\u2011carrier models), while recessive T\u2011allele model (CC vs CT+TT) associates with non\u2011response.\n\n3) Cytokine levels by genotype\n- CARD8 rs2043211:\n  - TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 levels increase markedly across AA \u2192 AT \u2192 TT (P < 0.0001 for both cytokines).\n  - AA: lowest TNF\u2011\u03b1 (~5.6 pg/mL) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (~1.05 pg/mL); TT: highest TNF\u2011\u03b1 (~14.3 pg/mL) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (~4.55 pg/mL).\n  - Dominant model (AA+AT vs TT): TT associated with substantially higher TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 (P < 0.0001).\n  - Recessive model (AA vs AT+TT): T\u2011carrier genotypes associated with higher cytokines (P < 0.0001).\n\n- NLRP3 rs4612666:\n  - Similarly, CC has lowest TNF\u2011\u03b1/IL\u20111\u03b2; TT has highest levels; both P < 0.0001.\n  - Recessive T\u2011allele model (CC vs CT+TT) significantly associated with higher TNF\u2011\u03b1 (P = 0.002) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (P < 0.0001).\n  - Dominant (CC+CT vs TT) model was not significantly associated with cytokine levels (TNF\u2011\u03b1 P = 0.764, IL\u20111\u03b2 P = 0.187), suggesting a threshold (recessive-like) effect for rs4612666.\n\nPharmacogenomic interpretation:\n- Neither variant confers strong *risk* for developing RA in this Iraqi population, but both are strong *modifiers* of disease course and biological drug response.\n- Functional rationale:\n  - CARD8 encodes a negative regulator of caspase\u20111 and NF\u2011\u03baB. The rs2043211 T allele introduces a premature stop codon (p.C10X), generating truncated CARD8 with reduced inhibitory capacity, leading to enhanced NF\u2011\u03baB signaling and increased IL\u20111\u03b2 and TNF\u2011\u03b1 production.\n  - NLRP3 is a core inflammasome component. The rs4612666 T allele has been linked in other work to altered intronic enhancer activity and reduced mRNA expression, but overall, this and prior RA studies suggest that NLRP3 variation modulates inflammasome activation and IL\u20111\u03b2 production in vivo.\n- Clinical consequence:\n  - Patients with CARD8 rs2043211 TT and/or NLRP3 rs4612666 TT genotypes exhibit:\n    - Higher systemic TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 despite TNF\u2011\u03b1 blockade.\n    - Higher DAS\u201128 and predominance of moderate/high disease activity.\n    - Significantly lower probability of achieving EULAR-defined response to etanercept or infliximab after 3 months.\n- This pattern is consistent with the idea that stronger/upstream inflammasome\u2011mediated IL\u20111\u03b2/TNF\u2011\u03b1 signaling in these genotypes overwhelms standard anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 therapy, making them \u201cpoor responders.\u201d\n\nClinical and research implications:\n- These data support NLRP3/CARD8 genotyping as candidate pharmacogenomic markers for predicting short\u2011term anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 response in RA, at least in this Iraqi cohort.\n- Patients carrying CARD8 rs2043211 T allele and/or NLRP3 rs4612666 T allele may:\n  - Be at higher risk for persistent high disease activity on infliximab or etanercept.\n  - Require closer early monitoring, faster therapy escalation, or alternative biologic strategies (e.g., IL\u20116 or IL\u20111 pathway targeting, JAK inhibitors).\n- However, clinical implementation is premature:\n  - Single\u2011center, modest sample size (n=100 RA).\n  - Only two SNPs studied; no correction for multiple testing discussed.\n  - Three\u2011month outcome window; long\u2011term predictive value is unknown.\n  - Findings may be population\u2011specific (Iraqi, Middle Eastern ancestry).\n\nLimitations acknowledged by authors:\n- Small cohort and drop\u2011outs before 3 months reduce power.\n- Female predominance typical for RA but limits sex\u2011stratified genetic analysis.\n- Only two inflammasome\u2011related SNPs examined; comprehensive NLRP3/CARD8 haplotypes not assessed.\n- Results may not generalize beyond the Iraqi population due to ethnic genetic heterogeneity.\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- In Iraqi RA patients, NLRP3 rs4612666 and CARD8 rs2043211 do not significantly alter RA susceptibility, but their variant (T) genotypes are strongly associated with:\n  - Higher TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 levels\n  - More active disease (higher DAS\u201128)\n  - Poorer clinical response to infliximab and etanercept at 3 months.\n- These SNPs are promising pharmacogenomic markers of anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 response and disease severity, supporting a central role of the NLRP3\u2013CARD8 inflammasome axis in RA pathobiology and biologic treatment outcomes.\n",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis prospective pharmacogenetic analysis nested in the N2R randomized trial examined whether CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 polymorphisms affect efavirenz and nevirapine plasma concentrations in Thai adults with HIV/TB co\u2011infection receiving rifampicin-containing TB therapy. One hundred twenty\u2011four antiretroviral\u2011na\u00efve patients on rifampicin for 4\u20136 weeks were started on standard-dose ART: efavirenz 600 mg once daily (n=65) or nevirapine 200 mg twice daily (after a 2\u2011week 200 mg once-daily lead\u2011in; n=59) plus lamivudine/stavudine. Patients had plasma NNRTI concentrations measured 12 hours post\u2011dose (C12) at week 6, week 12, and 1 month after stopping rifampicin. Seven SNPs were genotyped (CYP2B6: 516G>T, 777C>A, 415A>G, 1459C>T; CYP3A4: 566T>C, 878T>C, 1088C>T). Clinical outcomes (CD4, HIV\u20111 RNA) were followed up to 48 weeks.\n\nKey genotype frequencies:\n- CYP2B6 516G>T in efavirenz group (n=65): GG 38.5%, GT 47.7%, TT 13.9%.\n- CYP2B6 516G>T in nevirapine group (n=59): GG 44.1%, GT 52.5%, TT 3.4%.\n- Other CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 SNPs showed little or no variation; only CYP2B6 516G>T and CYP3A4 878T>C could be meaningfully evaluated, and CYP3A4 data were limited by very few variant carriers.\n\nMain pharmacokinetic findings (CYP2B6 516G>T):\n1. Efavirenz (strong effect, consistent over time)\n- Mean C12 (mg/L) at week 6 / week 12 / 1 month post\u2011rifampicin:\n  \u2022 TT: 10.97 \u00b1 2.32 / 13.62 \u00b1 4.21 / 8.48 \u00b1 1.30\n  \u2022 GT: 3.43 \u00b1 0.29 / 3.35 \u00b1 0.27 / 3.21 \u00b1 0.22\n  \u2022 GG: 2.88 \u00b1 0.33 / 2.45 \u00b1 0.26 / 2.08 \u00b1 0.16\n- TT carriers had ~3\u20135\u2011fold higher efavirenz concentrations than GG/GT at all time points (p<0.0001 versus either genotype).\n- Despite concomitant rifampicin\u2014a strong CYP inducer\u2014CYP2B6 516TT clearly identified poor metabolizers with markedly elevated efavirenz levels.\n\n2. Nevirapine (similar direction, weaker statistical support)\n- Mean C12 (mg/L) at week 6 / week 12 / 1 month post\u2011rifampicin:\n  \u2022 TT: 14.09 \u00b1 9.49 / 7.94 \u00b1 2.76 / 9.44 \u00b1 0.17\n  \u2022 GT: 5.65 \u00b1 0.54 / 5.58 \u00b1 0.48 / 7.03 \u00b1 0.64\n  \u2022 GG: 5.42 \u00b1 0.48 / 5.34 \u00b1 0.50 / 6.43 \u00b1 0.64\n- Trend toward higher nevirapine levels in TT carriers: significant at week 6 (p=0.003), not significant at week 12 (p=0.409) or 1 month post\u2011rifampicin (p=0.448), likely due to the very small number of TT subjects (n=2 in nevirapine arm).\n\nEffect of rifampicin versus genetics:\n- When not stratified by genotype, for the entire efavirenz group:\n  \u2022 Mean C12 decreased after rifampicin discontinuation: 4.26 mg/L (week 6) \u2192 3.5 mg/L (1 month post\u2011rifampicin); p=0.043 for week 6 vs post\u2011TB.\n- For nevirapine:\n  \u2022 Mean C12 increased after rifampicin discontinuation: 5.83 mg/L (week 6) \u2192 6.84 mg/L (1 month post\u2011rifampicin); p=0.034 (week 6 vs post\u2011TB), p<0.001 (week 12 vs post\u2011TB).\n- Nonetheless, the authors conclude that the magnitude of rifampicin\u2019s effect on efavirenz and nevirapine exposure was much smaller than the impact of CYP2B6 516TT; rifampicin did not \u201cnormalize\u201d the poor metabolizer phenotype.\n\nTherapeutic range and safety implications:\n- All genotype groups maintained efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations above conventional minimum target thresholds (efavirenz \u22651 mg/L; nevirapine \u22653.4 mg/L) even during rifampicin co\u2011therapy.\n- TT carriers had substantially higher efavirenz and likely higher nevirapine levels, raising theoretical concern for toxicity (e.g., CNS effects, rash, hepatotoxicity). In this study, TT patients generally tolerated therapy, but seven participants overall left the parent trial due to adverse events; genotypes of those individuals were not evaluated here.\n\nCYP3A4 878T>C:\n- Very few heterozygous carriers (3 efavirenz, 1 nevirapine). These individuals tended to have higher efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations than TT homozygotes, but numbers were too small for statistical analysis, so no firm conclusion on CYP3A4\u2019s effect was possible.\n\nVirologic and immunologic outcomes:\n- CD4+ T\u2011cell counts: increased robustly and similarly across CYP2B6 genotypes through 48 weeks in both efavirenz and nevirapine arms; no significant genotype effect on CD4 recovery.\n- Viral load suppression (HIV\u20111 RNA <50 copies/mL at week 12):\n  \u2022 Efavirenz: GG 68% (17/25), GT 77.4% (24/31), TT 88.9% (8/9); p=0.430.\n  \u2022 Nevirapine: GG 60% (15/26), GT 71.0% (23/31), TT 100% (2/2); p=0.288.\n- There was a non\u2011significant trend toward higher early suppression rates in TT carriers, consistent with higher drug exposure, but by weeks 24\u201348 almost all patients achieved undetectable viral loads regardless of genotype.\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- CYP2B6 516G>T is a major determinant of efavirenz exposure and a relevant determinant of nevirapine exposure in Thai HIV/TB patients, even in the presence of potent CYP induction by rifampicin.\n- Standard efavirenz 600 mg/day and nevirapine 400 mg/day appear sufficient to maintain therapeutic levels during rifampicin co\u2011treatment across genotypes in this population.\n- CYP2B6 516TT identifies individuals at risk for very high efavirenz (and possibly nevirapine) levels; in other settings, genotype\u2011guided dose reduction has been shown to reduce CNS toxicity. The study supports considering CYP2B6 genotyping when possible for optimizing efavirenz (and perhaps nevirapine) dosing, especially in populations with higher TT frequency.\n- Rifampicin modestly lowers efavirenz and modestly lowers then raises nevirapine concentrations after discontinuation, but its effect is smaller than genetic variability at CYP2B6 516.\n\nLimitations:\n- Single mid\u2011dose (C12) sampling; full pharmacokinetic profiles (AUC, Cmax, clearance) were not obtained.\n- Small sample size of CYP2B6 516TT (especially in the nevirapine arm) and of CYP3A4 variant carriers limits power for some comparisons.\n- Adverse event data were not linked to genotype, so tolerability of high concentrations in TT carriers cannot be fully assessed.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nIn rifampicin\u2011treated Thai adults with HIV/TB co\u2011infection, CYP2B6 516TT strongly elevates efavirenz and, to a lesser extent, nevirapine concentrations, whereas rifampicin co\u2011administration exerts only modest influence on NNRTI levels. Genotype\u2011driven variability in exposure is much larger than rifampicin\u2019s inducing effect. Standard dosing achieved effective virologic suppression across genotypes, but CYP2B6 516TT remains an important marker for high NNRTI exposure and a potential target for individualized dosing.\n",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis Canadian, multicenter, pediatric pharmacogenomics case\u2013control study evaluated whether HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 predict carbamazepine (CBZ) hypersensitivity in children of diverse ancestries. Forty\u2011two children with CBZ hypersensitivity (9 SJS/TEN, 6 HSS, 26 maculopapular exanthems [MPE], 1 AGEP) and 91 CBZ-tolerant controls (\u22658 weeks CBZ without reaction) were genotyped. Five oxcarbazepine (OXC) hypersensitivity cases were explored descriptively.\n\nGenotyping:\n- HLA-B*15:02 was directly typed with a commercial kit.\n- HLA-A*31:01 was assessed by sequence-based typing and by the proxy SNP rs1061235, known to be in complete LD with HLA-A*31:01 in Europeans.\n\nKey findings \u2013 HLA-A*31:01:\n- Strong association with CBZ-induced HSS:\n  - 3/6 HSS cases (50%) vs 3/91 controls (3.3%) carried HLA-A*31:01.\n  - OR 26.4; P = 0.0025.\n- Significant association with CBZ-induced MPE:\n  - 6/26 MPE cases (23.1%) vs 3/91 controls (3.3%).\n  - OR 8.6; P = 0.0037.\n- Combined HSS + MPE:\n  - 9/32 cases (28.1%) vs 3/91 controls (3.3%).\n  - OR 11.2; P = 2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2074.\n- No association with CBZ-SJS/TEN (0/9 SJS/TEN carriers of HLA-A*31:01; OR ~1, P = 1.0), though numbers were small.\n- Overall CBZ hypersensitivity (all phenotypes): 9/42 cases (21.4%) vs 3/91 controls (3.3%), OR 7.85; P = 0.0016.\n\nProxy SNP rs1061235:\n- rs1061235T also associated with HSS and MPE with similar effect sizes (combined HSS/MPE: OR 9.45; P = 2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2075).\n- rs1061235T remained overrepresented among cases even after excluding HLA-A*31:01 carriers, particularly in some non\u2011European ancestries (often tagging HLA-A*33:03), indicating that rs1061235 is not a reliable universal proxy for HLA-A*31:01 in multiethnic populations.\n\nKey findings \u2013 HLA-B*15:02:\n- Strong association with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN only:\n  - 3/9 SJS/TEN cases (33.3%) vs 1/87 genotyped controls (1.1%).\n  - OR 38.6; P = 0.0022.\n- All HLA-B*15:02\u2013positive SJS/TEN patients reported Asian ancestry (Chinese, Filipino, Sri Lankan, etc.), confirming ethnic enrichment and extending relevance to Sri Lankan origin.\n- No HLA-B*15:02 carriers among HSS or MPE cases; no association with these phenotypes.\n- Across all CBZ hypersensitivity phenotypes combined, HLA-B*15:02 was not significantly enriched due to its specificity for SJS/TEN and low allele frequency.\n\nCombined analysis:\n- Considering HLA-A*31:01 or HLA-B*15:02 as a combined test:\n  - 12/42 CBZ hypersensitivity cases (28.6%) vs 4/87\u201391 controls (\u22484\u20135%) carried at least one risk allele.\n  - Combined OR 8.14; P = 2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2074.\n  - Positive likelihood ratio \u22486.2.\n  - Assuming a baseline CBZ hypersensitivity risk of 5\u201310%, a positive test raises post-test risk to ~25\u201341%, whereas a negative test reduces it to ~3.8\u20137.7%.\n- The variants are neither necessary nor sufficient: most carriers tolerate CBZ, and some hypersensitivity cases lack both risk alleles.\n\nAncestry insights:\n- HLA-B*15:02 carriers were exclusively of Asian origin (mostly Chinese, one Filipino, one Sri Lankan), consistent with known population frequencies.\n- HLA-A*31:01 carriers were observed across multiple ancestries, including European, Aboriginal Canadian, and Latin American, confirming its broad global relevance.\n- Subgroup analysis restricted to children with predominantly European ancestry (\u22653 European grandparents) replicated the HLA-A*31:01 signal:\n  - All CBZ hypersensitivity: 4/20 cases (20%) vs 2/65 controls (3.1%), OR 7.62; P = 0.025.\n  - HSS/MPE: 4/16 (25%) vs 2/65 (3.1%), OR 10.05; P = 0.013.\n\nOXC hypersensitivity (exploratory):\n- Five OXC cases (2 SJS, 3 MPE): no clear pattern for HLA-A*31:01 or HLA-B*15:02, and sample size too small to conclude.\n\nClinical implications:\n- This is the first study to clearly demonstrate HLA-A*31:01 as a risk factor for CBZ-induced HSS and MPE in children and in a multiethnic North American setting, including European, Aboriginal, and Latin American ancestries.\n- HLA-B*15:02 is strongly and specifically associated with CBZ-SJS/TEN in pediatric patients of Asian ancestry, in line with adult data.\n- Given the severity of SJS/TEN and HSS, and the availability of alternative antiepileptic drugs, the authors advocate pre-prescription genotyping for both HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 in all children (and adults) considered for CBZ, irrespective of reported ancestry, especially in ethnically admixed populations.\n- rs1061235 should not be used alone as a universal surrogate for HLA-A*31:01 in diverse populations; direct HLA typing is preferable where possible.\n\nLimitations:\n- Modest sample size, particularly for SJS/TEN and HSS, limits precision of phenotype-specific odds ratios and may contribute to lack of observed association of HLA-A*31:01 with SJS/TEN.\n- Ancestry based on self-report without genetic confirmation, and controls skewed toward European origin.\n- No large OXC-tolerant control group to examine cross-reactivity.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nHLA-A*31:01 is a robust predictor of CBZ-induced HSS and MPE in children across multiple ancestries, while HLA-B*15:02 is a strong, specific marker for CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in Asian children. Combined HLA-A*31:01/HLA-B*15:02 testing in pediatric practice has substantial potential to reduce severe CBZ hypersensitivity, though further work is needed to refine risk prediction and clarify the role of HLA-A*31:01 in SJS/TEN and AGEP.\n",

    "summary": "Objective:\nTo examine how pharmacogenetic variation in CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A and SLC6A4 influences escitalopram pharmacokinetics and treatment\u2011emergent adverse events in depressed and/or anxious adolescents who have a first\u2011degree relative with bipolar I disorder (i.e., are at familial high risk for BD).\n\nDesign and population:\n- Double\u2011blind RCT parent study (psychotherapy + escitalopram vs psychotherapy + placebo); this pharmacogenetic analysis focuses only on the escitalopram\u2011treated arm.\n- Youth aged 12\u201317 years, antidepressant\u2011na\u00efve, with clinically significant depression and/or anxiety and at least one first\u2011degree relative with bipolar I disorder.\n- N = 66 escitalopram\u2011treated participants with pharmacogenetic data; N = 48 of these also had escitalopram serum levels and PK modeling.\n\nTreatment and assessments:\n- Escitalopram 5 mg \u2192 10 mg \u2192 target 20 mg/day (max 30 mg), flexible titration.\n- Adverse outcomes captured by:\n  - Clinician\u2011defined \u201chyperarousal event\u201d (CGI\u2011Severity of Activation + CGAS criteria).\n  - Pediatric Adverse Events Rating Scale (PAERS; 13 arousal\u2011related items, maximum severity after baseline).\n  - Treatment\u2011Emergent Activation and Suicidality Assessment Profile (TEASAP) caregiver\u2011reported subscales: (1) self\u2011injury/suicidality/harm to others, (2) mania, (3) akathisia/hyperkinesis/somatic anxiety, (4) disinhibition/impulsivity, (5) irritability.\n- Genotyping (Myriad panel): CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A \u22121438G>A (rs6311) and SLC6A4 5\u2011HTTLPR; CYP phenotypes assigned per CPIC.\n- Escitalopram PK (one or limited samples) modeled using Bayesian population PK (MwPharm, Strawn et al model) to estimate Cmax, Ctrough, AUC0\u201324 and t1/2; PK compared across CYP phenotypes (dose\u2011normalized for gene\u2013PK analyses; non\u2011normalized for exposure\u2013AE analyses).\n\nKey pharmacokinetic findings:\n1. CYP2C19 strongly influences escitalopram exposure in youth.\n- Phenotype distribution (PK subset, n=48): IM 21%, NM 50%, RM 27%, UM 2%; no poor metabolizers.\n- Slower CYP2C19 metabolism (IM > NM > RM/UM) was associated with:\n  - Higher dose\u2011normalized AUC0\u201324 (p = 0.025).\n  - Higher dose\u2011normalized Ctrough (p = 0.013).\n  - Longer escitalopram half\u2011life (t1/2; p = 0.0008).\n- Trend toward higher dose\u2011normalized Cmax in slower metabolizers (p = 0.057).\n- Confirms CPIC guidance: CYP2C19, not CYP2D6, is the primary PK driver for escitalopram in youth.\n\n2. CYP2D6 does not measurably affect escitalopram parent\u2011drug PK.\n- Phenotypes: PM 6%, IM 23%, NM 65%, UM 3%; 2 indeterminate.\n- No significant associations between CYP2D6 phenotype and dose\u2011normalized AUC, Cmax, Ctrough, or t1/2 (all p > 0.48).\n- Consistent with CYP2D6 having only a minor role in parent escitalopram clearance.\n\n3. Escitalopram exposure vs. adverse events.\n- Escitalopram Cmax and AUC0\u201324 (non\u2013dose\u2011normalized) were not significantly associated with:\n  - Hyperarousal events, nor\n  - TEASAP subscale changes.\n- There was a non\u2011significant trend for higher exposure to be associated with *lower* PAERS scores (p \u2248 0.11), opposite to the prior hypothesis that higher levels would drive more side effects.\n\nPharmacogenetic associations with adverse events:\n\nCYP2C19 \u2192 AEs\n- Despite clear PK effects, CYP2C19 phenotype was *not* significantly associated with:\n  - Hyperarousal event frequency.\n  - PAERS max scores.\n  - TEASAP mania, akathisia, disinhibition, or irritability subscales.\n- There was a non\u2011significant trend for higher TEASAP self\u2011injury/suicidality/harm\u2011to\u2011others scores in slower CYP2C19 metabolizers (p = 0.09), but this did not reach conventional significance and no poor metabolizers were present.\n\nCYP2D6 \u2192 activation\u2011like AEs (novel signal)\n- Slower CYP2D6 metabolizers (PM/IM) showed more SSRI\u2011like activation symptoms despite similar parent\u2011drug PK:\n  - TEASAP akathisia/hyperkinesis/somatic anxiety subscale: significantly higher in slower CYP2D6 phenotypes (p = 0.015 across PM/IM/NM/UM).\n  - When grouped as \u201cslower than normal\u201d (PM+IM) vs \u201cnormal/faster\u201d (NM+UM), slower CYP2D6 was also associated with:\n    - Higher disinhibition/impulsivity scores (mean 3.0 vs 1.1, p = 0.02).\n    - Trends toward higher mania and akathisia/hyperkinesis/somatic anxiety scores (p \u2248 0.07\u20130.08).\n- CYP2D6 phenotype was not associated with overall PAERS scores or hyperarousal event incidence.\n- Interpretation: CYP2D6 may modulate *activation\u2011type behavioral AEs* independent of parent escitalopram levels\u2014possibly by altering exposure to the active metabolite desmethylescitalopram, which is preferentially cleared by CYP2D6 and has a distinct pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., some NET binding, different receptor activities).\n\nHTR2A \u2192 suicidality/harm\u2011related behaviors\n- Genotype groups: 44% G/G, 56% A allele carriers (A/A or A/G).\n- A allele carriers (A/A + A/G) exhibited significantly greater increases in TEASAP \u201cself\u2011injury, suicidality, and harm to others\u201d scores than G/G homozygotes (p = 0.017).\n- No significant effect of HTR2A genotype on:\n  - Other TEASAP subscales (mania, akathisia, disinhibition, irritability).\n  - PAERS total.\n  - Categorical hyperarousal events.\n- This contrasts with earlier work where G/G was more associated with somatic side effects (e.g., nausea, dizziness) on SSRIs; here, A\u2011carriers appear at higher risk for high\u2011risk/suicidality\u2011related behaviors under escitalopram.\n- Suggests HTR2A may differentially predict somatic vs psychiatric AEs across genotypes and drugs.\n\nSLC6A4 \u2192 no association with AEs in this cohort\n- Genotype distribution: S/S 24%, L/S 56%, L/L 20%.\n- No significant associations between SLC6A4 S/S vs L\u2011carriers (L/L+L/S) and:\n  - TEASAP subscales.\n  - PAERS.\n  - Hyperarousal events.\n- This negative finding contrasts with prior studies implicating S/S in greater activation, mania\u2011like symptoms, or poorer SSRI response, but the current sample was relatively small.\n\nHyperarousal events\n- 14 escitalopram\u2011treated participants experienced a clinician\u2011defined hyperarousal event; 12 had genotype data; 5 had PK data.\n- No clear pharmacokinetic predictor (Cmax, AUC) or robust pharmacogenetic predictor of these discrete events was identified, likely due to low numbers and under\u2011representation of hyperarousal cases in the PK subset.\n\nClinical and research implications:\n1. CYP2C19:\n   - Strongly shapes escitalopram exposure in high\u2011risk youth, supporting CPIC\u2011style dose adjustment in pediatrics.\n   - However, within this modestly sized cohort lacking CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, CYP2C19 phenotype did not significantly predict activation or other escitalopram\u2011related AEs.\n\n2. CYP2D6:\n   - Does *not* materially affect escitalopram parent\u2011drug PK, but slower metabolizers showed more akathisia\u2011like and disinhibition symptoms.\n   - Raises the hypothesis that CYP2D6\u2011mediated handling of active metabolites (e.g., desmethylescitalopram) could influence behavioral activation independent of parent\u2011drug exposure.\n   - Clinically, youth at familial risk for BD who are CYP2D6 slower metabolizers may warrant closer monitoring for akathisia/activation and impulsivity when exposed to escitalopram or related SSRIs.\n\n3. HTR2A:\n   - A\u2011allele carriers (A/A or A/G) appear more vulnerable to increases in caregiver\u2011reported self\u2011injury/suicidality/harm\u2011to\u2011others under escitalopram.\n   - If replicated, HTR2A could be used as an additional risk marker for SSRI\u2011associated suicidal or aggressive behaviors in high\u2011risk youth, distinct from CYP\u2011based PK considerations.\n\n4. SLC6A4:\n   - No AE signal in this small cohort; does not rule out effects on efficacy or on other phenotypes but suggests that, at least for escitalopram\u2011induced activation in familial\u2011risk youth, SLC6A4 is not a major determinant.\n\n5. General:\n   - The overall AE burden did not clearly correlate with escitalopram exposure (Cmax/AUC), suggesting that idiosyncratic pharmacodynamic mechanisms and metabolite effects may be more important than steady\u2011state parent\u2011drug levels for activation\u2011like AEs in this context.\n\nLimitations:\n- Small sample size for pharmacogenetic subgroup analyses, especially for extreme CYP phenotypes (no CYP2C19 PMs, few CYP2D6 PMs/UMs).\n- Only 48 had PK data and only 5 of 14 hyperarousal cases contributed PK samples \u2192 limited power to detect exposure\u2013AE relationships.\n- Multiple statistical tests performed without correction \u2192 risk of type I error; findings should be considered preliminary and hypothesis\u2011generating.\n- Single time\u2011point PK modeling and no direct measurement of desmethylescitalopram or didesmethylescitalopram.\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- In high\u2011risk adolescents treated with escitalopram, CYP2C19 phenotype robustly influences escitalopram pharmacokinetics but did not, in this small sample, translate into clear differences in activation or other AEs.\n- CYP2D6 slower\u2011metabolizer status and HTR2A A\u2011allele genotypes were associated with more activation\u2011like and suicidality/harm\u2011related behavioral AEs, respectively, despite minimal effect of CYP2D6 on parent\u2011drug PK.\n- These preliminary findings suggest that integrating CYP2D6 and HTR2A into pharmacogenomic risk assessment may help identify youth at elevated risk for escitalopram\u2011associated activation and self\u2011harm/aggression, but larger, prospectively powered cohorts are needed before changing clinical practice.\n\n\nPMID: 38377518\nPMCID: PMC10880264\nTitle: Pharmacogenetic Factors Influence Escitalopram Pharmacokinetics and Adverse Events in Youth with a Family History of Bipolar Disorder: A Preliminary Study",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis single-center retrospective study evaluated whether pre-treatment UGT1A1*6 genotyping can safely individualize irinotecan dosing as second-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer, and whether genotype-guided dosing affects efficacy.\n\nPatients and genotyping:\n- 110 Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) received second-line chemotherapy after fluoropyrimidine + platinum regimens.\n- UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 were genotyped before treatment.\n- Genotype distribution:\n  - UGT1A1*6: GG (wild-type) 60.9%, GA 31.8%, AA 7.3%.\n  - UGT1A1*28: TA6/TA6 70.9%, TA6/TA7 25.5%, TA7/TA7 3.6%.\n\nGenotype-guided regimen:\n- Irinotecan q3w, given on days 1 and 8 of each cycle, with dose based on UGT1A1*6:\n  - GG: 125 mg/m\u00b2 (full dose).\n  - GA: 100 mg/m\u00b2 (~20% reduction).\n  - AA: 75 mg/m\u00b2 (~40% reduction), or early switch to paclitaxel if severe toxicity; 3 AA patients were started directly on paclitaxel 125 mg/m\u00b2.\n- Total: 107 patients received irinotecan; 3 AA patients received only paclitaxel.\n\nEfficacy outcomes:\n- Median follow-up: 9.0 months.\n- For the whole cohort:\n  - Median PFS: 4.4 months.\n  - Median OS: 8.7 months.\n- PFS by UGT1A1*6:\n  - GG: 4.8 months (95% CI 4.1\u20135.5).\n  - GA: 4.9 months (95% CI 4.4\u20135.3).\n  - AA: 4.4 months (95% CI 3.9\u2013NA).\n- OS by UGT1A1*6:\n  - GG: 9.3 months (95% CI 8.8\u201310.9).\n  - GA: 9.3 months (95% CI 8.7\u2013NA).\n  - AA: not reached (95% CI 8.8\u2013NA), though number of AA patients was very small and many switched to paclitaxel.\n- PFS and OS by UGT1A1*28 (TA6/6 vs TA6/7 vs TA7/7) were similar; no significant differences.\n- Combined allele analyses (single vs double variant alleles across *6 and *28) also showed no significant efficacy differences.\n- Univariable and multivariate Cox analyses:\n  - UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 were not associated with PFS or OS.\n  - Independent prognostic factors for OS were diffuse-type Lauren classification (worse prognosis) and having had prior surgery (better prognosis).\n\nToxicity outcomes and pharmacogenetic signal:\n- UGT1A1*28:\n  - No significant association with diarrhea, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia (all p > 0.1).\n- UGT1A1*6:\n  - Significant association with key irinotecan toxicities despite genotype-based dose adjustment:\n    - Delayed diarrhea: p = 0.000.\n    - Leukopenia: p = 0.003.\n    - Neutropenia: p = 0.000.\n  - Toxicities increased stepwise from GG \u2192 GA \u2192 AA.\n- Grade 3\u20134 toxicity rates by UGT1A1*6 (from Table 3 and text):\n  - Diarrhea:\n    - GG: 2%.\n    - GA: 23%.\n    - AA: 100%.\n  - Leukopenia:\n    - GG: 19%.\n    - GA: 31%.\n    - AA: 100%.\n  - Neutropenia:\n    - GG: 24%.\n    - GA: 31%.\n    - AA: 100%.\n- Even with a 40% irinotecan dose reduction, all AA patients who received irinotecan experienced severe hematologic and/or gastrointestinal toxicity; in 5 of 8 AA patients, treatment had to be switched to paclitaxel. Three additional AA patients were placed on paclitaxel alone up front due to anticipated risk.\n- Thrombocytopenia and anemia were not significantly linked to either *6 or *28 genotype.\n\nInterpretation and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- In this East Asian cohort, UGT1A1*6\u2014rather than *28\u2014was the key determinant of irinotecan-related delayed diarrhea and myelosuppression.\n- Dose-reduced irinotecan in GA carriers achieved PFS and OS comparable to full-dose irinotecan in GG patients, but GA patients still had more toxicity than GG despite the 20% reduction.\n- Homozygous UGT1A1*6 (AA) patients had excessive severe toxicity even at 40% dose reduction; most required switching to paclitaxel, but their survival was not obviously inferior after that switch (though numbers are very small and estimates unstable).\n- Overall, genotype-guided irinotecan dosing by UGT1A1*6 allowed:\n  - Maintenance of similar survival across *6 genotypes when AA patients were promptly switched to paclitaxel.\n  - Marked differentiation of toxicity risk, highlighting AA as a very high-risk group for irinotecan.\n\nClinical take-home points for pharmacogenomics:\n- Pre-treatment UGT1A1*6 testing is clinically useful in Chinese/East Asian gastric cancer patients being considered for irinotecan:\n  - GG: full-dose irinotecan is reasonable; toxicity profile acceptable.\n  - GA: use dose-reduced irinotecan with careful monitoring; toxicity still higher than GG.\n  - AA: irinotecan is likely unsuitable even at substantially reduced dose; consider alternative agents such as paclitaxel instead of irinotecan.\n- UGT1A1*28 testing adds little for toxicity prediction in this East Asian setting, consistent with prior data that *6 is the dominant functional variant for irinotecan in Asians.\n- The study supports moving toward UGT1A1*6-guided personalization of irinotecan but underscores the need for larger, ideally prospective, trials and better dosing strategies for GA patients, who remain at elevated risk despite preemptive dose reduction.\n\nLimitations:\n- Retrospective, single-center, small sample size\u2014especially very few AA patients.\n- No non-genotyped control arm and no pure paclitaxel control group.\n- Patients with AA genotype were partially or entirely switched to paclitaxel, confounding direct comparisons of efficacy between genotypes under irinotecan.\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- Individualized irinotecan dosing guided by UGT1A1*6 is feasible and appears to balance efficacy and tolerability for non-AA patients with advanced gastric cancer.\n- UGT1A1*6 AA homozygotes experience prohibitive toxicity despite dose reduction and are poor candidates for irinotecan; paclitaxel is a more appropriate second-line choice in this genotype group.\n\npmid: 38497131\npmcid: PMC10946077\n\ntitle: Individual Irinotecan Therapy Under the Guidance of Pre-Treated UGT1A1*6 Genotyping in Gastric Cancer",

    "summary": "Objective:\nTo determine whether CYP2D6 metabolizer status is associated with the risk of adverse events (AEs) from risperidone in children and adolescents, and to explore the potential clinical value of pre-emptive CYP2D6 genotyping.\n\nDesign and population:\n- Retrospective cohort using BioVU, a de-identified DNA biobank linked to electronic health records at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n- Inclusion: children \u226418 years with \u22654 weeks of risperidone exposure and available, non-compromised DNA.\n- Exclusion: care primarily outside VUMC, insufficient dosing/follow-up data, or genetically ambiguous CYP2D6 phenotype.\n- Final analyzed cohort: 257 pediatric patients (median age 8.3 years; 73% male; 84% White).\n\nCYP2D6 genotyping and phenotype assignment:\n- Next-generation sequencing (Kailos TargetRich PGx panel) plus long-range PCR for copy number variation.\n- Star-allele calling followed by phenotype categorization (poor, intermediate, normal, ultrarapid metabolizers) according to standard activity-based schemes.\n- Distribution: 15 poor (6%), 18 intermediate (7%), 218 normal (85%), 6 ultrarapid (2%).\n- For analysis, poor + intermediate were grouped (\"reduced function\"), and normal + ultrarapid were grouped (\"normal/increased function\"), due to small subgroup sizes and some ambiguous CNV cases being excluded (13 patients).\n\nExposure and outcome definitions:\n- Risperidone exposure: any use \u22654 weeks; median starting dose 0.5 mg/day (IQR 0.5\u20131 mg/day); indications primarily behavioral (e.g., aggression, behavioral problems, irritability, agitation, self-injury), often comorbid with autism, ADHD, seizure disorders, etc.\n- Primary outcome: any AE attributed to risperidone in the EHR (by clinician or caregiver report, observation, or lab change). No formal causality assessment; any temporally associated AE documented as risperidone-related was counted.\n- Detailed AE characterization (type, timing, dose at AE, management changes) was obtained via blinded manual chart review.\n\nAdverse events \u2013 frequency and types:\n- 76 of 257 patients (30%) experienced at least one AE; 104 total AE episodes across 20 AE types.\n- Most common AEs:\n  - Weight change/weight gain (~9%).\n  - Sedation (~6%).\n  - Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS; ~6%).\n- AE rates by metabolic phenotype:\n  - Poor: 5/15 (33%) with AEs.\n  - Intermediate: 10/18 (56%).\n  - Normal: 58/218 (27%).\n  - Ultrarapid: 3/6 (50%).\n\nAssociation of CYP2D6 phenotype with AEs:\n- Grouped comparison: poor/intermediate (n=33) vs normal/ultrarapid (n=224).\n- Unadjusted AE rates:\n  - Poor/intermediate: 15/33 (46%).\n  - Normal/ultrarapid: 61/224 (27%).\n  - P = 0.04.\n- Multivariable logistic regression (primary analysis):\n  - Outcome: occurrence of any AE.\n  - Main predictor: poor/intermediate vs normal/ultrarapid metabolizer.\n  - Covariates: age at risperidone start, sex, race, initial risperidone dose.\n  - Adjusted odds ratio for AE in poor/intermediate vs normal/ultrarapid: OR 2.4 (95% CI 1.1\u20135.1), P = 0.03.\n- No significant differences in demographics, comorbidities, indications, or baseline dosing between metabolizer groups, suggesting the genotype\u2013AE association is not explained by these factors.\n\nOther factors associated with AEs:\n- In univariate analyses (independent of CYP2D6 status):\n  - Race, aggression, and self-injurious behaviors were associated with higher AE rates.\n  - These associations were not clearly independent of other variables in multivariable models that included CYP2D6 status.\n\nImpact of CYP2D6 inhibitors:\n- Among normal/ultrarapid metabolizers (n=224), 20 (9%) were taking \u22651 strong CYP2D6 inhibitor concurrently.\n- AE rates:\n  - With inhibitor: 6/20 (30%).\n  - Without inhibitor: 55/204 (27%).\n  - P = 0.8.\n- Adjusted analysis in normal/ultrarapid group (controlling for age, sex, race, dose):\n  - Concomitant strong CYP2D6 inhibitor: OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.4\u20133.3), P = 0.7.\n- Interpretation: In this cohort, measured clinically significant AE risk was driven more by CYP2D6 genotype than by strong inhibitor co-medication.\n\nInterpretation in context of risperidone pharmacology:\n- Risperidone is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 to 9-hydroxyrisperidone (paliperidone), an active metabolite.\n- Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced CYP2D6 activity, leading to higher parent risperidone exposure and altered risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone ratios, which may increase risk for certain AEs (weight gain, EPS, sedation, etc.).\n- Prior pediatric data have been inconsistent due to small numbers, differing AE definitions, and different genotyping panels, but several studies converge on increased risk of weight gain and potentially other AEs in patients with reduced CYP2D6 function.\n\nStrengths:\n- Relatively large pediatric cohort (n=257) for risperidone pharmacogenetics.\n- Comprehensive CYP2D6 genotyping with CNV characterization.\n- Blinded manual AE ascertainment from detailed EHR review.\n- Adjustment for key clinical covariates (age, sex, race, starting dose) in regression.\n\nLimitations:\n- Single-center retrospective study; limited generalizability.\n- AE capture relies on documentation quality; no standardized AE rating scales or prospective causality assessment.\n- Small numbers of poor (n=15), intermediate (n=18), and ultrarapid (n=6) metabolizers; power was insufficient to analyze each phenotype class separately or to precisely characterize specific AE patterns in ultrarapid metabolizers.\n- Many patients were on multiple concomitant medications; while no major confounding was detected statistically, residual confounding by co-therapy or underlying illness severity is possible.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics:\n- CYP2D6 poor and intermediate metabolizer phenotypes approximately doubled the adjusted risk of any risperidone-related AE compared with normal/ultrarapid metabolizers.\n- About one-third of pediatric risperidone users in this cohort experienced at least one AE, underscoring the overall need for close monitoring.\n- While no CPIC or other formal dosing guideline yet exists for risperidone based on CYP2D6, this and prior data support the following genotype-informed considerations:\n  - CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers:\n    - Consider alternative antipsychotic or mood stabilizing agents that are less dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism where clinically appropriate.\n    - If risperidone is used, start at a lower dose and titrate more slowly.\n    - Implement heightened surveillance for metabolic AEs (weight, BMI, lipids, glucose), hyperprolactinemia, and movement disorders; counsel families regarding increased AE risk.\n  - CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers:\n    - Data remain limited and conflicting; some evidence suggests risk for prolactin-related AEs due to higher paliperidone exposure, but this was not seen here, likely due to small numbers.\n    - Increased vigilance is still warranted until larger studies clarify risk patterns.\n- For high-risk pediatric populations (e.g., overweight/obese patients, those with neurologic comorbidities, or those where AEs would be particularly problematic), pre-prescription CYP2D6 testing may help guide drug choice, dosing, and monitoring intensity.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nThis study provides evidence that reduced CYP2D6 function (poor or intermediate metabolizer phenotype) in children and adolescents is associated with a significantly higher risk of risperidone-attributed adverse events, independent of age, sex, race, and starting dose. Genotype-guided selection and dosing of risperidone, along with more intensive AE monitoring in reduced-function CYP2D6 phenotypes, is a reasonable strategy, and larger prospective studies are warranted to refine and standardize pharmacogenomic guidance for pediatric risperidone therapy.",

Rare promoter variants linked to *8 were also observed.\n  - VKORC1 \u22121639G>A: ~62% carriers (GA or AA).\n  - CYP4F2*3: allele frequency 0.11; ~20% carriers.\n  - NQO1*2: allele frequency 0.10; ~18% carriers.\n  - A rare VKORC1 V45A resistance variant and H7 resistance haplotypes were identified in a few subjects.\n- Ancestry proportions (European, West African, Native American) were estimated using STRUCTURE on 332 ancestry\u2011informative SNPs. Many individuals showed substantial three\u2011way admixture.\n- Native American ancestry was associated with higher frequency of low\u2011dose requirements (<3 mg/day).\n\nModel development (dose refinement after day 3\u20134)\n- Outcome: stable therapeutic warfarin maintenance dose (mg/day).\n- Predictors evaluated: demographic (age, body size, gender), clinical (indication, comorbidities, co\u2011medications, smoking, diet, day\u20111\u20133 doses, INR at day 3, target INR), genetics (CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2*3, NQO1*2, EPHX1 variants), and an admixture index (categorical: European, Native American, African, admixed).\n- Final multiple linear regression (stepwise) model included 13 predictors:\n  - Age (lower dose with older age)\n  - Initial dose (D1)\n  - Target INR (tINR)\n  - Dose\u2011adjusted INR on day 3 (INR/D3)\n  - CYP2C9*2, *3, *8 carrier status\n  - VKORC1 \u22121639 GA and AA\n  - CYP4F2*3\n  - NQO1*2\n  - Admixture index (admixed status associated with lower dose)\n  - Amiodarone co\u2011therapy\n\nKey effect directions (per variant or covariate):\n- CYP2C9 decreased\u2011function alleles (*2, *3, *8): 7\u201331% lower dose per allele (combined ~18% decrease per variant overall).\n- VKORC1 \u22121639 A allele: ~13% lower dose per A allele.\n- CYP4F2*3: ~17% higher dose per allele.\n- NQO1*2: ~10% higher dose per allele (borderline significance).\n- Admixed ancestry category: ~7% lower dose.\n- Each 0.25\u2011unit increase in INR/D3: ~11% lower final dose.\n- Age: ~5% lower dose per decade.\n\nPerformance in derivation cohort\n- Admixture\u2011adjusted pharmacogenetic refinement model:\n  - R\u00b2 = 0.70 (70% dose variance explained)\n  - MAE = 0.72 mg/day;

not a randomized trial of genotype\u2011guided vs standard dosing.\n- Admixture index was coded categorically rather than using continuous ancestry proportions in the final regression.\n- Genotype and admixture turnaround times (2\u20133 days) mean the algorithm is for *refinement after day ~4*, not for initial dosing.\n\nClinical outlook\n- The authors are launching a prospective, multicenter randomized trial in Caribbean Hispanics (NCT02345356) to test whether this admixture\u2011adjusted pharmacogenetic refinement algorithm improves clinical outcomes (e.g., bleeding, time in therapeutic range) versus standard care.\n- If validated, such ancestry\u2011informed pharmacogenomic dosing could reduce warfarin\u2011related adverse events and dosing disparities in Caribbean Hispanics and potentially other admixed Latino populations.\n\nIn essence, this work shows that in Caribbean Hispanics, a warfarin dose\u2011refinement algorithm that integrates CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2, NQO1, early INR response, and individual admixture provides substantially better and more clinically useful dose predictions than existing clinical or pharmacogenetic tools built in less admixed populations.",

    "summary": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated whether specific HLA alleles are associated with severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) triggered by sulfamethoxazole (SMX) or cotrimoxazole (CTX). Six case\u2013control studies (322 SCAR cases; 236 SJS/TEN, 86 DRESS; 8448 healthy and 229 drug-tolerant controls) from diverse populations (European, Japanese, Thai, Taiwanese, Malaysian) were included.\n\nAcross all SCAR phenotypes, multiple class I HLA alleles showed significant risk associations. Compared with healthy controls, SMX/CTX-induced SCARs were associated with HLA-A*11:01 (OR\u22482.2), HLA-B*07:05 (\u22482.9), HLA-B*13:01 (\u22485.4), HLA-B*15:02 (\u22481.9), HLA-B*38:01 (\u22484.3), HLA-B*38:02 (\u22483.2), HLA-C*03:04 (\u22483.3), HLA-C*04:06 (\u22483.3), HLA-C*07:27 (\u224811.4), and HLA-C*08:01 (\u22481.5). Using SMX/CTX-tolerant controls\u2014more relevant for clinical prediction\u2014significant risk was confirmed for HLA-A*11:01 (OR 2.10), HLA-B*13:01 (5.96), HLA-B*15:02 (2.23), HLA-B*38:02 (3.47), and HLA-C*08:01 (2.63).\n\nPhenotype-specific patterns emerged:\n- SJS/TEN: strongly associated with HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*38:02 versus both healthy and tolerant controls; HLA-B*07:05, B*13:01, B*38:01, C*04:06, C*07:27, and C*08:01 were also associated in healthy-control analyses.\n- DRESS: associated with HLA-A*68:01, HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*38:01, HLA-B*39:01, HLA-C*03:04, and HLA-C*07:27 (vs healthy controls), and with HLA-A*68:01, HLA-B*13:01, and HLA-B*39:01 (vs tolerant controls). HLA-B*13:01 conferred very high risk for DRESS (OR\u224824 vs healthy; \u224823 vs tolerant controls) and was linked to both SJS/TEN and DRESS.\n\nGeographic analyses showed that:\n- HLA-B*13:01 is a major risk allele in Thai, Malaysian, and Taiwanese cohorts.\n- HLA-A*11:01 is implicated in Japanese and Thai patients.\n- HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-C*08:01 are particularly relevant in Thais.\n- HLA-B*38:02 is important in Taiwanese, and HLA-B*38:01/B*38:02 in Europeans.\n\nIn HIV-positive Thai cohorts receiving CTX (largely for Pneumocystis prophylaxis), odds ratios for several alleles (A*11:01, B*07:05, B*13:01, B*15:02, B*38:02, C*07:27, C*08:01) were even higher when compared to HIV-positive tolerant controls, suggesting additive risk in this population.\n\nMechanistically, the authors discuss that SMX and its reactive metabolite 4-nitro-SMX likely form drug\u2013HLA\u2013peptide complexes that activate specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell clones. Structural and functional work in related literature shows SMX/4-nitro-SMX can bind pockets in HLA-B*13:01 and HLA-B*38:02, and that overlapping risk with dapsone hypersensitivity (also linked to HLA-B*13:01) may underlie observed cross-reactivity. TCR usage (e.g., V\u03b220-1) and class II HLA-DQ\u2013restricted CD4+ responses may further shape phenotype-specific outcomes (SJS/TEN vs DRESS).\n\nKey limitations include dominance of Southeast Asian cohorts, mixture of SMX vs CTX as culprit drugs, limited tolerant-control data, incomplete phenotype stratification in some studies, and potential confounding by HLA haplotype linkage disequilibrium (e.g., A*11:01\u2013B*15:02\u2013C*08:01 in East Asians).\n\nClinically, the study supports that multiple HLA alleles\u2014especially HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*38:02, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*68:01, HLA-B*39:01, and HLA-C*08:01\u2014confer increased risk of SMX/CTX-induced SCARs, with phenotype- and ancestry-specific patterns. While not yet ready for universal guideline-level implementation, these data argue for consideration of pre-prescription HLA screening in high-incidence populations (e.g., Southeast Asians, particularly for HIV-positive individuals on CTX), analogous to carbamazepine\u2013HLA testing, pending further validation and cost-effectiveness analyses.",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis single-center retrospective pharmacogenetic study evaluated whether NUDT15 R139C (rs116855232) and TPMT*3C (rs1142345) variants predict azathioprine (AZA)\u2013induced leukopenia and influence tolerated AZA dose in Chinese patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and AIH\u2013PBC overlap, many with cirrhosis.\n\nPopulation and treatment:\n\u2022 149 consecutive Chinese patients with definite/probable AIH or AIH\u2013PBC variant syndrome treated with AZA \u22653 months at West China Hospital (2013\u20132017).  \n\u2022 70 had AIH\u2013PBC overlap; 81 had cirrhosis at AZA start.  \n\u2022 AZA introduced after steroids per EASL guidance; target maintenance 1\u20132 mg/kg/day.  \n\u2022 CBCs closely monitored; leukopenia defined as WBC <3\u00d710\u2079/L, or progressive worsening if pre\u2011existing.<br>\n\u2022 13 patients had leukopenia already before AZA (baseline WBC ~2.5\u00d710\u2079/L).\n\nGenotyping and metabolite measurement:\n\u2022 NUDT15 rs116855232 (C>T; p.Arg139Cys) and TPMT*3C rs1142345 (T>C; p.Leu125Leu) genotyped by PCR + Sanger sequencing.  \n\u2022 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6\u2011TGN) in RBCs measured by HPLC in 61 patients.\n\nGenotype frequencies:\n\u2022 NUDT15: CC 82.6% (123/149), CT 16.1% (24/149), TT 1.3% (2/149); T-allele frequency 9.4%.  \n\u2022 TPMT*3C: 3 heterozygotes (TC) and 1 homozygote (CC); risk allele frequency ~1.7%.\n\nIncidence and timing of leukopenia:\n\u2022 Overall AZA-induced leukopenia occurred in 12/149 (8.1%).  \n\u2022 All leukopenia episodes developed within 60 days of AZA initiation or dose escalation.  \n\u2022 No significant differences in baseline age, sex, liver function, disease severity, cirrhosis, splenomegaly, or baseline WBC between those with and without leukopenia.\n\nAssociation of NUDT15 with leukopenia:\n\u2022 Leukopenia by NUDT15 genotype:\n  \u2013 CC: 1/123 (0.8%).  \n  \u2013 CT: 9/24 (37.5%).  \n  \u2013 TT: 2/2 (100%).\n\u2022 Strong association between T allele and leukopenia:  \n  \u2013 OR 20.41 (95% CI 7.84\u201353.13), P < 0.00001.  \n  \u2013 Dominant model (CT+TT vs CC): OR 89.47 (95% CI 10.78\u2013742.53), P < 0.0001.  \n  \u2013 Recessive model (TT vs CC+CT): OR 65.48 (95% CI 2.95\u20131454.21), P = 0.008.  \n\u2022 Predictive performance of carrying at least one T allele: sensitivity 91.67%, specificity 89.05%.  \n\u2022 Among NUDT15 variant carriers (CT+TT), 11/26 (42.3%) developed AZA-induced leukopenia.\n\u2022 One TT patient with coexisting TPMT wt/risk developed life\u2011threatening grade 4 myelosuppression within 4 weeks at ~1.1 mg/kg/day; AZA was stopped and mycophenolate mofetil used thereafter. The other TT patient required dose reduction from 0.9 to 0.2 mg/kg/day.\n\nAssociation of TPMT*3C with leukopenia:\n\u2022 No significant association between TPMT*3C genotype and leukopenia (P = 0.283).  \n\u2022 Very low allele frequency in this Chinese cohort, consistent with prior Asian data; TPMT explained little of the leukopenia risk.\n\nNUDT15, 6\u2011TGN, and maintenance dose:\n\u2022 6\u2011TGN levels (61 patients):  \n  \u2013 Median (overall): 149.1 pmol/8\u00d710\u2078 RBC (range 49.7\u20131583.4).  \n  \u2013 NUDT15 CC: 145.3 (87.4\u2013199.0) pmol/8\u00d710\u2078 RBC.  \n  \u2013 NUDT15 CT: 276.6 (150.9\u2013501.0) pmol/8\u00d710\u2078 RBC.  \n  \u2013 P = 0.002 \u2192 heterozygotes accumulate significantly more active metabolite at comparable doses.\n\u2022 Among 93 patients in biochemical remission on maintenance AZA:  \n  \u2013 NUDT15 CC median maintenance dose: 1.23 (0.95\u20131.53) mg/kg/day.  \n  \u2013 NUDT15 CT median maintenance dose: 0.96 (0.83\u20131.19) mg/kg/day.  \n  \u2013 P = 0.028 \u2192 heterozygotes tolerate and require lower AZA doses.  \n\u2022 Dose/6\u2011TGN ratio (AZA dose per unit 6\u2011TGN) was significantly lower in CT vs CC (0.005 vs 0.007, P = 0.013), reinforcing that CT carriers generate more 6\u2011TGN per mg of AZA.\n\u2022 6\u2011TGN concentration itself did not differ significantly between patients with and without leukopenia (P = 0.149) and was not associated with gender, AZA maintenance dose, or cirrhosis severity.\n\nBaseline leukopenia subgroup:\n\u2022 13 patients started AZA with pre\u2011existing leukopenia (median WBC 2.48\u00d710\u2079/L);  \n  \u2013 Only 1 was NUDT15 CT; none showed progressive leukopenia on AZA.  \n  \u2013 Only one stopped AZA due to gastrointestinal side effects, not marrow toxicity.  \n  \u2013 Median maintenance dose was 1.13 (0.94\u20131.60) mg/kg/day.  \n\u2022 Suggests that, in NUDT15 wild-type patients, pre\u2011treatment leukopenia from cirrhosis/hypersplenism does not necessarily preclude safe AZA use at standard doses, though this finding needs prospective validation.\n\nBiochemical efficacy and NUDT15:\n\u2022 Among 93 patients achieving biochemical remission:  \n  \u2013 75 (80.6%) were NUDT15 CC; 17 (18.3%) were CT.  \n  \u2013 No significant difference in remission rates by genotype (P = 0.361) or time to remission (median 3.0 vs 4.0 months; P = 0.161).  \n\u2022 Thus, lowering AZA dose in NUDT15 heterozygotes to avoid leukopenia does not appear to compromise biochemical control in this cohort.\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n\u2022 In this Chinese AIH/AIH\u2013PBC population, NUDT15 R139C\u2014but not TPMT*3C\u2014is the main pharmacogenetic determinant of AZA\u2011induced leukopenia and tolerated dose.  \n\u2022 NUDT15 T\u2011allele carriers have markedly higher risk of early leukopenia and accumulate more 6\u2011TGN at any given AZA dose.\n\u2022 For NUDT15 CT patients with AIH or AIH\u2013PBC:\n  \u2013 Use a lower AZA maintenance dose ~1 mg/kg/day (or less) as a default target.  \n  \u2013 Intensively monitor counts in first 2 months; most leukopenia events occur early.  \n\u2022 For NUDT15 TT patients, very low starting doses (e.g., 0.1\u20130.2 mg/kg/day) or alternative immunosuppressants should be strongly considered, given near-universal severe myelosuppression at standard doses.\n\u2022 In East Asian settings, NUDT15 genotyping has higher clinical utility than TPMT for thiopurine safety; nonetheless, combined TPMT+NUDT15 testing is advisable because rare combined defects can be catastrophically toxic.\n\u2022 Standard AZA doses may still be appropriate in patients with cirrhosis or hypersplenism-related leukopenia if they are NUDT15 wild-type, but prospective data are needed.\n\nLimitations:\n\u2022 Single-center, modest sample size, rare TT and TPMT*3C variants; confidence intervals are wide for some genotype strata.  \n\u2022 Only rs116855232 and TPMT*3C were tested; rarer functional variants may have been missed.  \n\u2022 6\u2011TGN measured in only ~41% of patients.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nNUDT15 rs116855232 is a strong predictor of AZA-induced leukopenia and dose tolerance in Chinese patients with AIH and AIH\u2013PBC overlap, outperforming TPMT*3C. Heterozygous NUDT15 carriers can generally be treated safely and effectively with lower AZA doses (~1 mg/kg/day), and even in patients with cirrhosis or prior leukopenia, AZA need not be contraindicated if NUDT15 is wild-type. Routine pre\u2011treatment NUDT15 (and TPMT) genotyping should be incorporated into thiopurine prescribing for this population.\n",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis ENCORE1 pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic\u2013pharmacogenetic substudy evaluated whether efavirenz 400 mg once daily (EFV400) maintains virologic efficacy at 96 weeks despite lower plasma concentrations than the standard 600 mg dose (EFV600), and how pharmacokinetics and key genetic variants in drug-metabolizing enzymes/transporters relate to efficacy, toxicity, and treatment discontinuation.\n\nPopulation and methods:\n- 606 treatment\u2011na\u00efve HIV\u2011infected adults from 38 sites worldwide (37% African, 33% Asian; 32% female) on tenofovir/emtricitabine plus randomized EFV400 (n=311) or EFV600 (n=295).\n- Population PK model based on sparse and intensive sampling at weeks 4\u201312 estimated individual EFV AUC24, Cmax, C24, and C12.\n- Genotyping: CYP2B6 (516G>T, 983T>C, 15582C>T), CYP2A6 (*9B, *17), CYP3A4*22, NR1I3 (CAR 540C>T, 1089T>C), NR1I2 (PXR 63396C>T, 7635A>G), ABCB1 3435C>T.\n- Primary PD endpoint: HIV RNA <200 copies/mL at week 96.\n- Safety endpoints: EFV discontinuation (>30 d interruption), overall EFV\u2011related adverse events (AEs), CNS AEs, and discontinuation due to EFV\u2011related AEs.\n- Also tested validity of the widely used efavirenz \u201cminimum effective concentration\u201d (MEC) of 1.0 mg/L (mid\u2011interval C12).\n\nKey efficacy findings:\n- Virologic suppression was very high and similar between doses at week 96:\n  - EFV400: 97% <200 copies/mL\n  - EFV600: 99% <200 copies/mL (p=0.091)\n- Only 2% (13/575 with available VL) had pVL \u2265200 copies/mL at week 96.\n- No EFV PK parameter (AUC24, Cmax, C24, C12) was significantly associated with achieving pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks in logistic regression; effect estimates were imprecise due to the very low failure rate.\n- None of the tested SNPs, nor metabolizer status defined by composite CYP2B6/CYP2A6 genotypes, was associated with virologic failure.\n\nToxicity and discontinuation:\n- Overall EFV discontinuation to 96 weeks was 12% (11% EFV400 vs 13% EFV600; p=0.395).\n- EFV-related AEs were more frequent with EFV600:\n  - EFV\u2011related AEs (per Stocrin PI): 73% EFV600 vs 66% EFV400 (p=0.043).\n  - EFV\u2011related AEs (clinician-attributed): 46% EFV600 vs 38% EFV400 (p=0.048).\n  - Discontinuation due to EFV\u2011related AE (clinician decision): 8% EFV600 vs 3% EFV400 (p=0.019).\n- EFV dose (600 vs 400 mg) independently predicted stopping due to EFV\u2011related AEs (HR\u22482.5; 95% CI ~1.2\u20135.4).\n- CNS AEs (abnormal dreams, insomnia, dizziness, etc.) were common but similar by dose (42% EFV400 vs 46% EFV600, p=0.287) and were not explained by EFV plasma levels.\n\nPK\u2013toxicity relationships:\n- Paradoxically, patients who discontinued or stopped for EFV\u2011related AEs tended to have *lower* EFV exposure:\n  - Overall discontinuation: AUC24, Cmax, C12 ~14\u201316% lower in non\u2011discontinuers.\n  - Stopping due to EFV\u2011related AEs: AUC24 and C12 ~19\u201322% lower in non\u2011stoppers.\n- However, EFV concentrations were *not* associated with CNS AEs; PK metrics did not differ meaningfully between those with and without CNS toxicity.\n\nPharmacogenetic findings (safety/discontinuation):\n1. Overall EFV discontinuation (time\u2011to\u2011event Cox models adjusted for age, sex, country, dose):\n   - Increased risk:\n     - CYP2B6 516 GT: HR ~1.8 vs GG.\n     - CYP2B6 516 TT: HR ~2.7 vs GG.\n     - CYP2A6*9B CA/AA: HR ~2.0 vs CC.\n   - Decreased risk:\n     - NR1I2 63396 TT: HR ~0.2 vs CC (\u224878% lower risk of discontinuation).\n   - ABCB1 3435C>T and most other SNPs did not consistently predict overall discontinuation after full adjustment.\n\n2. CNS AEs (multivariable logistic models):\n   - Decreased risk of CNS AEs:\n     - CYP2B6 983 TC/CC: OR ~0.3 (\u224865\u201370% lower risk) vs TT.\n   - Increased risk of CNS AEs:\n     - CYP2B6 15582 CT/TT: OR ~1.6 vs CC.\n     - ABCB1 3435 TT: OR ~2.1 vs CC.\n   - These associations suggest that CYP2B6 and ABCB1 variants modulate CNS tolerability, likely via effects on formation and CNS penetration/clearance of toxic efavirenz metabolites (e.g., 8\u2011hydroxy\u2011efavirenz), rather than via the parent EFV concentration.\n\n3. EFV\u2011related AEs (overall):\n   - After multivariable adjustment, specific SNPs did not retain significant associations with the composite EFV\u2011related AE endpoints, except via their effects on discontinuation and CNS AEs noted above.\n\nRe\u2011evaluation of the 1.0 mg/L MEC:\n- Using model\u2011predicted C12 at weeks 4\u201312:\n  - pVL \u2265200 copies/mL at week 96\n    - C12 \u22651.0 mg/L: 2% (11/557)\n    - C12 <1.0 mg/L: 11% (2/18; 2 further with missing VL; p=0.059).\n  - Sensitivity/specificity of C12=1.0 mg/L for week\u201196 pVL <200 copies/mL: 97.1% / 84.6% (LR\u22486).\n- ROC analysis showed multiple candidate C12 cutoffs with sensitivity and specificity both >90% in the ~0.47\u20130.76 mg/L range, implying:\n  - A single, sharp MEC is statistically weak in this setting.\n  - Values substantially below 1.0 mg/L still predict high likelihood of long\u2011term suppression, especially in adherent patients.\n- Because only 2% had virologic failure, the power to define any robust MEC is low, and PK at week 4\u201312 may not fully reflect exposures at week 96. Nonetheless, the data strongly question the clinical relevance of the traditional EFV MEC of 1.0 mg/L in modern, potent backbone regimens.\n\nInterpretation and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- EFV400 maintained non\u2011inferior virologic suppression to 96 weeks despite lower systemic exposure across all genotypes and metabolizer categories.\n- Neither \u201csubtherapeutic\u201d concentrations (by old MEC criteria) nor the genotypes tested (CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP3A4*22, ABCB1, NR1I3, NR1I2) predicted virologic failure in this well\u2011adherent, treatment\u2011na\u00efve cohort.\n- Polymorphisms in CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 primarily affected EFV exposure and overall discontinuation risk, and selectively influenced CNS toxicity (CYP2B6 983, 15582), but these effects did not negate the efficacy advantage of EFV400.\n- ABCB1 3435 TT\u2014despite EFV itself not being a P\u2011gp substrate\u2014was associated with significantly higher CNS AEs, possibly via altered transport of the neurotoxic 8\u2011hydroxy\u2011efavirenz metabolite across the blood\u2013brain barrier.\n- NR1I2 63396 TT appeared protective against discontinuation, likely reflecting increased pregnane X receptor (PXR) activity, enhanced CYP3A4 expression, and slightly lower EFV exposure.\n\nClinical and public\u2011health conclusions:\n- EFV400 once daily is pharmacodynamically adequate for long\u2011term viral suppression across diverse ethnicities and pharmacogenetic backgrounds.\n- EFV600\u2019s higher rate of EFV\u2011related AEs and AE\u2011driven discontinuations is largely dose\u2011driven and not explained by the polymorphisms examined.\n- Routine EFV therapeutic drug monitoring to target a fixed \u201cMEC\u201d (1.0 mg/L) is not supported by this dataset, especially in resource\u2011limited settings.\n- Implementing EFV dose reduction to 400 mg could:\n  - Reduce CNS and other EFV\u2011related toxicities and discontinuations.\n  - Maintain excellent virologic efficacy.\n  - Lower drug costs and potentially expand ART coverage.\n- Additional PK/PD work is still needed before applying EFV400 in specific high\u2011risk groups (e.g., pregnancy, concomitant rifampicin\u2011based TB therapy), but ENCORE1 provides strong justification that, for typical ART\u2011na\u00efve adults, EFV400 is an effective and more tolerable dose.\n\nIn essence, this comprehensive 96\u2011week PK/PD/pharmacogenetic analysis shows that interindividual PK variability and genetic polymorphisms in EFV metabolism/transport do not compromise the effectiveness of EFV400, while toxicities\u2014particularly CNS AEs and AE\u2011driven discontinuations\u2014are substantially reduced compared with EFV600.\n",

    "summary": "Study objective:\nTo identify clinical and pharmacogenomic risk factors for adverse events\u2014especially hematologic toxicity\u2014during treatment with nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5\u2011fluorouracil and L\u2011leucovorin (nal\u2011IRI/FL) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, focusing on UGT1A1*6/*28 polymorphisms.\n\nDesign and population:\n- Single-center, retrospective cohort at Wakayama Medical University Hospital (Japan).\n- 36 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who initiated nal\u2011IRI/FL between June 2021 and May 2022.\n- UGT1A1 status: 16 wild\u2011type (\u2013/\u2013), 16 heterozygous (+/\u2013), 4 homozygous/compound heterozygous (+/+ for *6 or *28).\n\nTreatment and genotyping:\n- Regimen: nal\u2011IRI + 5\u2011FU + L\u2011leucovorin after prior gemcitabine-based therapy.\n- Dosing was at the physician\u2019s discretion; patients with UGT1A1*6/*28 (+/+) received significantly lower starting nal\u2011IRI doses than other genotypes.\n\nEndpoints and assessments:\n- Adverse events:\n  - Hematologic: nadir white blood cell (WBC) count, nadir neutrophil count; CTCAE v5.0 grading of leukopenia/neutropenia.\n  - Non\u2011hematologic: incidence of any\u2011grade diarrhea.\n- Baseline covariates: UGT1A1 genotype, liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin), renal function (eGFR), tumor location (e.g., pancreatic head vs others), and other clinical characteristics.\n\nKey results:\n1) UGT1A1 polymorphisms and hematologic toxicity\n- Nadir WBC counts (median [IQR], /mm\u00b3):\n  - UGT1A1 (\u2013/\u2013): 3,340 (2,950\u20135,120)\n  - UGT1A1 (+/\u2013): 3,220 (2,520\u20133,923)\n  - UGT1A1 (+/+): 2,050 (1,550\u20132,513)\n  - WBC nadir was significantly lower in UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) vs other groups (p=0.033).\n\n- Nadir neutrophil counts (median [IQR], /mm\u00b3):\n  - UGT1A1 (\u2013/\u2013): 1,930 (1,540\u20132,782)\n  - UGT1A1 (+/\u2013): 1,285 (1,093\u20132,113)\n  - UGT1A1 (+/+): 860 (407\u20131,616)\n  - Neutrophil nadir was significantly lower in UGT1A1 (+/+) (p=0.043).\n\n- Incidence of grade 3\u20134 leukopenia and neutropenia:\n  - UGT1A1 (\u2013/\u2013): ~7.1%\n  - UGT1A1 (+/\u2013): 12.5%\n  - UGT1A1 (+/+): 50.0%\n  - Differences showed a strong trend toward significance (p=0.085) despite the small (+/+) sample size.\n\n- Multiple regression analyses (continuous nadirs):\n  - Lower WBC nadir was independently associated with:\n    - UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) genotype (p=0.009)\n    - Higher baseline AST (p=0.019)\n    - Pancreatic head tumor location (p=0.030)\n  - Lower neutrophil nadir was independently associated with:\n    - UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) genotype (p=0.017)\n  - Total bilirubin was excluded from multivariable models due to collinearity with UGT1A1 genotype.\n\n2) Diarrhea\n- 7 patients were excluded from diarrhea analysis because they were on prophylactic loperamide from the start of nal\u2011IRI/FL.\n- Among 29 evaluable patients, incidence of any\u2011grade diarrhea:\n  - UGT1A1 (\u2013/\u2013): 27.3%\n  - UGT1A1 (+/\u2013): 21.4%\n  - UGT1A1 (+/+): 25.0%\n- Multivariate logistic regression did not identify any significant predictors of diarrhea, including UGT1A1 polymorphisms.\n\n3) Dosing and toxicity context\n- Overall incidence of grade \u22653 neutropenia (14.7%) was notably lower than reported in Japanese phase 2 data (~45.7%), likely reflecting more conservative or individualized dosing (especially dose reductions in UGT1A1 (+/+) patients).\n- Nevertheless, patients with UGT1A1*6/*28 (+/+) still had substantially more severe myelosuppression, supporting a strong pharmacogenomic effect even under reduced dosing.\n\nPharmacogenomic/PK interpretation:\n- UGT1A1*6 and *28 reduce glucuronidation of SN\u201138, the active irinotecan metabolite, increasing exposure and hematologic toxicity.\n- Prior phase I nal\u2011IRI studies and population PK analyses show:\n  - Higher SN\u201138 exposure and more severe neutropenia in *6/*28 or homozygous/compound heterozygous patients.\n  - Higher unencapsulated SN\u201138 Cmax in Asians vs Caucasians, which may contribute to the higher neutropenia risk in this Japanese cohort.\n- The current study\u2019s data, showing marked neutropenia in UGT1A1 (+/+) despite reduced starting doses, are consistent with this PK/PGx relationship.\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- UGT1A1-guided dosing:\n  - Patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) are at high risk of leukopenia and neutropenia on nal\u2011IRI/FL.\n  - Even with empiric dose reductions, these patients had markedly lower WBC/neutrophil nadirs and higher rates of grade 3\u20134 myelosuppression.\n  - The data support routine pre\u2011treatment UGT1A1 genotyping (at least for *6 and *28 in East Asian populations) and proactive dose adjustment and monitoring, in line with existing irinotecan pharmacogenomic guidance.\n\n- Non\u2011genetic risk factors for hematologic toxicity:\n  - Elevated baseline AST and pancreatic head tumor location were independent predictors of lower WBC nadir.\n  - These likely reflect impaired hepatobiliary function (e.g., biliary obstruction from pancreatic head tumors), which could reduce SN\u201138 clearance and increase unencapsulated SN\u201138 exposure, further enhancing myelosuppression.\n  - Clinically, patients with high AST or pancreatic head tumors may warrant more cautious initial nal\u2011IRI dosing and closer blood count monitoring, even if UGT1A1 is wild type or heterozygous.\n\n- Diarrhea risk:\n  - No significant relationship between UGT1A1 genotype or other measured variables and diarrhea was found, possibly due to small sample size and exclusion of patients receiving prophylactic loperamide.\n  - This contrasts with prior larger studies showing more severe diarrhea in UGT1A1 homozygotes/compound heterozygotes.\n\nLimitations:\n- Small, single-center, retrospective study; only 4 patients were UGT1A1 (+/+), limiting precision of effect estimates.\n- No pharmacokinetic sampling of irinotecan or SN\u201138 to directly relate toxicity to systemic exposures.\n- Heterogeneity in starting doses, reflecting real\u2011world practice but complicating quantitative dose\u2013toxicity interpretation.\n\nOverall conclusion (from a pharmacogenomics perspective):\n- UGT1A1*6/*28 homozygous or compound heterozygous genotype is a strong, independent risk factor for severe leukopenia and neutropenia in Japanese patients treated with nal\u2011IRI/FL, even under reduced dosing.\n- Elevated AST and pancreatic head tumor location appear to be additional non\u2011genetic predictors of leukopenia, likely via effects on hepatic/biliary handling of irinotecan/SN\u201138.\n- These findings support integrated risk stratification combining UGT1A1 genotyping with baseline liver function and tumor location to guide nal\u2011IRI dosing and monitoring in metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nTitle:\nRisk Factors for Adverse Events of Nanoliposomal Irinotecan Plus 5-Fluorouracil and L-leucovorin\n\nPMID:\n38707740\n\nPMCID:\nPMC11062152",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis pharmacogenomic study evaluated how polymorphisms in drug\u2011metabolizing enzymes and transporters affect steady\u2011state simvastatin plasma concentrations in Thai patients. Eighty\u2011nine adults with dyslipidemia or coronary artery disease, taking a stable dose of simvastatin (5\u201340 mg/day) for \u22652 weeks, were recruited. Trough (12\u2011h post\u2011dose) plasma concentrations of simvastatin lactone (SVL) and simvastatin hydroxy acid (SVA) were quantified by UHPLC\u2013MS/MS and normalized by dose (Css/Dose). Ten SNPs in seven pharmacokinetic genes (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, CYP3A4, CYP3A5) were genotyped using the MassARRAY platform.\n\nKey genotypes and allele frequencies:\n- SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (rs4149056): TT 89.9%, TC 10.1%, CC 0%; C\u2011allele frequency 5.1%.\n- SLCO1B1 c.388A>G (rs2306283): AA 19.1%, AG 37.1%, GG 43.8%; G\u2011allele frequency 62.4%.\n- Other transporter and CYP variants had frequencies consistent with prior Thai data, and most were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nMain pharmacokinetic findings:\n1. SLCO1B1 c.521T>C and SVA levels\n- Carriers of the SLCO1B1 c.521 variant (TC+CC) had significantly higher dose\u2011normalized SVA trough concentrations than TT homozygotes:\n  - Median SVA Css/Dose: 0.53 vs 0.19 ng/mL (p = 0.03).\n- SVL levels did not differ significantly by c.521 genotype.\n\n2. SLCO1B1 haplotypes/diplotypes (per CPIC nomenclature)\n- Alleles considered: *1a, *1b (normal function), *5, *15 (no/loss\u2011of\u2011function components around c.521C \u00b1 c.388G).\n- Diplotypes:\n  - *1a/*1a: reference, median SVA Css/Dose 0.16 ng/mL.\n  - *1a/*1b and *1b/*1b: numerically higher but not significantly different from *1a/*1a.\n  - *1b/*15: significantly higher SVA Css/Dose than *1a/*1a (0.58 vs 0.16 ng/mL, p < 0.001).\n  - *1b/*5: rare (n=2); SVA levels low and not clearly different but underpowered.\n- When grouped by predicted OATP1B1 function (CPIC\u2011style phenotypes):\n  - Normal function (two normal\u2011function alleles: *1a/*1a, *1a/*1b, *1b/*1b) vs decreased function (*1b/*5, *1b/*15):\n    - SVA Css/Dose: 0.19 vs 0.53 ng/mL, p = 0.07 (trend toward significance).\n\n3. Dose\u2011stratified observations (exploratory):\n- At 10 mg/day (most common dose), c.521 TC+CC carriers had higher SVA than TT (5.83 vs 1.95 ng/mL, p = 0.06).\n- At 10 mg/day, SLCO1B1 c.388 AG+GG carriers had significantly higher SVA than AA (3.63 vs 1.59 ng/mL, p = 0.04).\n- No consistent dose effect was seen at 5, 20, or 40 mg, but these strata were small.\n\n4. Other PK genes:\n- No significant associations were found between SVL or SVA levels and polymorphisms in:\n  - ABCB1 rs1045642\n  - ABCC2 rs717620, rs3740066\n  - ABCG2 rs2231142\n  - SLCO1B3 rs7311158, rs4149117\n  - CYP3A4*1G rs2242480\n  - CYP3A5*3 rs776746\n- ABCC2, ABCG2, and CYP3A variants may still influence statin PK in other settings, but they were not detectable contributors to 12\u2011h steady\u2011state SVL or SVA in this cohort.\n\nMethodological notes:\n- Sampling at 12 h post\u2011dose reflects trough steady\u2011state exposure rather than full AUC or Cmax.\n- SVL LLOQ was 0.05 ng/mL; SVA LLOQ 0.2 ng/mL; assay was linear and precise within 0.05\u201350 ng/mL.\n- All SNPs had >95% call rate; most were in HWE. A multivariate analysis indicated no meaningful batch effect confounding the SLCO1B1\u2013SVA association.\n\nInterpretation and mechanistic link:\n- OATP1B1 (encoded by SLCO1B1) mediates hepatic uptake of SVA. Reduced function of OATP1B1 impairs hepatic clearance of SVA, increasing systemic exposure and thereby myotoxicity risk.\n- SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (V174A) is a functional variant that disrupts membrane localization and reduces transporter activity. In vitro data show decreased OATP1B1 expression and transport for the C allele, consistent with higher observed SVA levels.\n- The *1b/*15 diplotype combines the c.388G and c.521C variants and corresponds to a decreased/no\u2011function OATP1B1 phenotype, explaining the marked SVA elevation.\n- The findings in Thais are concordant with previous Caucasian and East Asian studies linking rs4149056 to higher SVA AUC/Cmax and to statin\u2011associated myopathy.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics and statin prescribing:\n- This is the first study directly linking pharmacokinetic gene variants to steady\u2011state simvastatin concentrations in Thai patients.\n- Key implication: SLCO1B1 genotyping (particularly rs4149056, and secondarily rs2306283 as part of haplotypes) is clinically relevant in Thailand for simvastatin therapy.\n- For carriers of c.521C or decreased\u2011function diplotypes (e.g., *1b/*15):\n  - Expect higher SVA exposure at standard simvastatin doses.\n  - This phenotype is associated, in larger external studies, with increased risk of statin\u2011induced myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.\n  - CPIC (2022) recommends using lower simvastatin doses or selecting alternative statins less dependent on OATP1B1 (e.g., pravastatin, fluvastatin, or possibly low\u2011dose rosuvastatin with ABCG2 consideration) in decreased/poor function SLCO1B1 genotypes.\n- Given simvastatin\u2019s high use and reimbursement as an essential medicine in Thailand, integrating SLCO1B1 pharmacogenetic testing could:\n  - Reduce statin\u2011induced musculoskeletal symptoms and severe myotoxicity.\n  - Help avoid unnecessary discontinuation of statins and maintain LDL\u2011C control.\n\nLimitations:\n- Modest sample size (n=89) with low frequency of c.521C carriers and no CC homozygotes or poor\u2011function (*5/*5 or *15/*15) diplotypes, limiting power.\n- Only a single trough time point was measured; AUC and Cmax were not captured.\n- Dose\u2011stratified analyses were underpowered, particularly at 5 and 40 mg.\n- Myotoxicity outcomes (e.g., clinically significant myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or CK elevations beyond modest CPK values) were not directly analyzed; links to clinical toxicity are inferred from prior literature.\n\nAuthors\u2019 conclusion:\n- In Thai patients, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C and the *1b/*15 diplotype (decreased OATP1B1 function) are significantly associated with higher steady\u2011state plasma SVA concentrations.\n- Other tested PK variants (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, SLCO1B3, CYP3A4*1G, CYP3A5*3) do not meaningfully affect SVA or SVL trough levels in this cohort.\n- These findings support the clinical value of SLCO1B1 genotyping\u2014especially rs4149056, together with rs2306283 for haplotype assignment\u2014to guide simvastatin/statin selection and dosing in Thai patients, in line with CPIC recommendations. Larger outcome\u2011oriented studies are needed to confirm the impact on statin\u2011induced myotoxicity rates in this population.",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis single-center, longitudinal observational study evaluated whether functional variants in TPMT and NUDT15 predict thiopurine-related toxicity in Colombian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving 6\u2011mercaptopurine (6\u2011MP) during BFM ALLIC 2009 maintenance therapy in 2017.\n\nPopulation and methods:\n\u2022 70 pediatric ALL patients (1\u201318 years) in maintenance were enrolled; 68 had DNA of sufficient quality for genotyping.\n\u2022 Exclusions: age <1 year and Down syndrome.\n\u2022 SNPs tested by TaqMan allelic discrimination real-time PCR:\n  \u2013 NUDT15 rs116855232 (c.415C>T)\n  \u2013 TPMT rs1800462 (*2), rs1800460 (*3B component), rs1142345 (*3C component)\n\u2022 Outcomes over the first 6 months of maintenance:\n  \u2013 Myelotoxicity (neutropenia), liver toxicity (ALT/AST, bilirubin)\n  \u2013 6\u2011MP dose reduction or interruption\n  \u2013 Exploratory: febrile neutropenia, relapse, death.\n\nKey clinical characteristics:\n\u2022 Median age at start of maintenance: 6 years.\n\u2022 B\u2011lineage ALL: 92.9%; T\u2011ALL: 7.1%.\n\u2022 Risk groups: standard 10%, intermediate 48.6%, high 41.4%.\n\u2022 During 6\u2011month follow\u2011up:\n  \u2013 Myelotoxicity: 25%\n  \u2013 Liver toxicity: 27%\n  \u2013 6\u2011MP dose reduction: 32.9%\n  \u2013 6\u2011MP interruption: 28.6%\n  \u2013 Febrile neutropenia: 11.4%\n  \u2013 Relapse: 15.7%;

2 of these also carried rs1142345 variants.\n\u2022 Longitudinal lab parameters (WBC, neutrophils, aminotransferases, bilirubin) showed no significant genotype-based differences.\n\nInterpretation and context:\n\u2022 This is the first Colombian pediatric ALL pharmacogenomic study assessing both TPMT and NUDT15.\n\u2022 The NUDT15 risk allele frequency (0.03) was lower than in East Asian cohorts but within the range of admixed Latin American populations, likely reflecting substantial European (50\u201360%) ancestry in this Colombian Andean cohort.\n\u2022 TPMT *2 and *3A frequencies were modestly higher than a previous Colombian report but in the range described for Latin American populations; only intermediate-activity genotypes (*1/*2, *1/*3A) were observed, with no poor-metabolizer diplotypes.\n\u2022 The lack of statistically significant genotype\u2013toxicity associations is plausibly explained by:\n  \u2013 Small sample size (68 genotyped patients, very few variant carriers), which limits power.\n  \u2013 Absence of TPMT or NUDT15 poor metabolizers (no homozygous risk genotypes).\n  \u2013 Possible differences in ancestry structure and environmental or treatment factors relative to the populations in which strong associations have been reported.\n\nImplications for pharmacogenomics and clinical practice:\n\u2022 In this real-world Colombian pediatric ALL cohort, TPMT and NUDT15 variants as tested (major CPIC-relevant alleles) did not predict 6\u2011MP toxicity or dose adjustments during the first 6 months of BFM ALLIC 2009 maintenance.\n\u2022 Given the low frequency of high-risk genotypes, routine testing may yield few actionable findings in this setting unless done in larger or pooled cohorts.\n\u2022 Nonetheless, given robust evidence from other populations and current CPIC guidelines, TPMT/NUDT15 genotyping remains biologically and clinically relevant; this study emphasizes that effect sizes and allele frequencies may vary by ancestry, reinforcing the need for local data.\n\nAuthors\u2019 conclusions and recommendations:\n\u2022 Allele frequencies of TPMT and NUDT15 in this Colombian cohort differ somewhat from previously described Latin American estimates, but fall within a broadly similar range.\n\u2022 No statistically significant associations were identified between the polymorphisms studied and thiopurine-related toxicity or treatment modifications.\n\u2022 Larger, ideally multicenter, studies in Colombia and Latin America are needed to:\n  \u2013 Achieve adequate power to detect genotype\u2013toxicity relationships.\n  \u2013 Investigate additional variants in TPMT, NUDT15 and other thiopurine pathway genes.\n  \u2013 Explore the role of detailed genetic ancestry in modifying pharmacogenomic effects.\n\u2022 The authors highlight the need to search for \u201cautochthonous biomarkers\u201d tailored to admixed Latin American populations to better predict thiopurine toxicity in pediatric oncology and potentially in other thiopurine-treated pediatric diseases (e.g., IBD, JIA).",

    "summary": "Objective:\nTo systematically review pharmacogenetic variants associated with antiretroviral drug\u2013induced liver injury (ARVDILI) from non\u2011nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and to quantify the association between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and efavirenz (EFV)\u2011 or nevirapine (NVP)\u2011induced liver injury in people living with HIV (PLHIV).\n\nMethods:\n- Databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science (to Oct 10, 2024), PROSPERO-registered (CRD42024593948).\n- Step 1 (systematic review): Identified original human studies evaluating genetic polymorphisms and ARVDILI with antiretrovirals. Genes were compiled and protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) networks analyzed using STRING/KEGG to prioritize candidates.\n- Step 2 (meta-analysis): Focused on CYP2B6, given high report frequency and network centrality.\n  - Inclusion: HIV-infected adults on EFV or NVP; assessment of CYP2B6 variants and ARVDILI risk; case\u2013control or cohort design; liver injury defined using CIOMS/RUCAM or explicit biochemical criteria; no major hepatic comorbidities or strong confounders.\n  - Quality: Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale; only studies scoring >6 included.\n  - Statistics: Mantel\u2013Haenszel fixed-effects model; odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs; heterogeneity by I\u00b2 and \u03c7\u00b2; funnel plots for publication bias; sensitivity analysis by leave\u2011one\u2011out.\n\nSystematic review findings (all ARVs):\n- 50 articles were included in the overall pharmacogenomic survey; 39 reported gene\u2013ARVDILI associations.\n- Most frequently studied genes for ARVDILI:\n  - UGT1A1 (11 reports)\n  - CYP2B6 (11 reports)\n  - ABCB1 (4 reports)\n  - HLA-Cw (mainly HLA-Cw*04) (2 reports)\n  - HLA-DRB1 (2 reports)\n- PPI/KEGG network analysis:\n  - The collected ARVDILI-associated proteins were significantly enriched in xenobiotic/drug metabolism pathways.\n  - CYP2B6, CYP1A1 and CYP2D6 emerged as central hubs, suggesting that phase I biotransformation pathways are critical in ARVDILI pathogenesis.\n  - CYP2B6 was chosen as the primary candidate for quantitative synthesis.\n\nMeta-analysis: CYP2B6 and EFV-induced liver injury\n\nStudy set:\n- 3 studies (2 cohorts, 1 case\u2013control), all in African populations (Tanzania, Ethiopia).\n- Total: 795 PLHIV on EFV\n  - 106 ARVDILI cases\n  - 689 non-ARVDILI controls\n- DILI defined by CIOMS criteria; controls drawn from hospital-based HIV cohorts.\n- Main variant: CYP2B6*6 haplotype, characterized by rs3745274 (516G>T, Q172H) and rs2279343 (785A>G, K262R), associated with reduced enzyme expression (\u224850\u201375% lower) but preserved catalytic site.\n\nResults (EFV):\n- Compared to CYP2B6*1/*1 (normal metabolizers), carriers of CYP2B6*6 had significantly higher risk of EFV-induced liver injury:\n  - Heterozygotes (*1/*6): OR 1.83 (95% CI 1.15\u20132.90), P = 0.01; I\u00b2 = 0%\n  - Homozygotes (*6/*6): OR 2.48 (95% CI 1.28\u20134.79), P = 0.007; I\u00b2 = 0%\n  - Any *6 ( *1/*6 + *6/*6 vs *1/*1 ): OR 1.94 (95% CI 1.24\u20133.01), P = 0.003; I\u00b2 = 0%\n- Sensitivity analyses: Excluding any single study did not materially alter the pooled estimates.\n- Funnel plots: Symmetric; no substantial publication bias detected.\n\nInterpretation (EFV):\n- CYP2B6*6 (poor/slow metabolizer phenotype) increases susceptibility to EFV-related hepatotoxicity.\n- Mechanistic rationale:\n  - CYP2B6 is the major catalyst of EFV primary and secondary metabolism.\n  - Reduced CYP2B6 activity leads to higher EFV exposure.\n  - EFV and its primary metabolite 8\u2011hydroxy\u2011EFV (8\u2011OH\u2011EFV) are both hepatotoxic: they impair mitochondrial membrane potential, reduce O\u2082 consumption, increase ROS, and trigger apoptosis in hepatocytes.\n  - Accumulation of EFV and 8\u2011OH\u2011EFV likely underlies the higher DILI risk in CYP2B6*6 carriers.\n\nMeta-analysis: CYP2B6 and NVP-induced liver injury\n\nStudy set:\n- 2 case\u2013control studies: Malawi/Uganda (African) and Italy (Caucasian).\n- Total: 820 PLHIV on NVP\n  - 38 ARVDILI cases\n  - 782 non-ARVDILI controls\n- DILI definitions: RUCAM or ALT > 40 IU/L with jaundice; hospital-based controls.\n\nResults (NVP):\n- Compared with CYP2B6*1/*1 (normal metabolizers):\n  - Heterozygotes (*1/*6): OR 0.44 (95% CI 0.22\u20130.91), P = 0.03; I\u00b2 = 0%\n  - Homozygotes (*6/*6): OR 0.45 (95% CI 0.15\u20131.32), P = 0.14; I\u00b2 = 0% (not statistically significant, wide CI)\n  - Any *6 ( *1/*6 + *6/*6 vs *1/*1 ): OR 0.42 (95% CI 0.21\u20130.84), P = 0.01; I\u00b2 = 0%\n- Sensitivity analyses: The protective association for *1/*6 and *1/*6 + *6/*6 persisted when studies were removed one by one.\n- Funnel plots: No major asymmetry; no strong publication bias signal.\n\nInterpretation (NVP):\n- In contrast to EFV, CYP2B6*6 was associated with a *lower* risk of NVP-induced liver injury (especially in heterozygotes).\n- Possible mechanisms and explanations:\n  - NVP is metabolized by multiple P450s (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, etc.) to several hydroxylated species (2-, 3-, 8-, 12\u2011OH\u2011NVP) and a carboxy metabolite.\n  - 12\u2011OH\u2011NVP, primarily a CYP3A4 product, has been more strongly linked to hepatotoxicity and skin rash than 8\u2011OH\u2011NVP, the CYP2B6\u2011related metabolite.\n  - Reduced CYP2B6 activity might shift the metabolic balance toward pathways that yield less hepatotoxic intermediates, or reduce formation of specific reactive metabolites.\n  - However, previous experimental and clinical data (e.g., LiverTox, Ciccacci et al.) suggest that CYP2B6 induction/bioactivation can generate toxic NVP intermediates, supporting a role for CYP2B6 in toxicity as well.\n  - The net effect may depend heavily on combined CYP2B6\u2013CYP3A4\u2013CYP2D6 genotypes and other host/environmental factors.\n- Authors emphasize that the NVP findings are based on few studies and small case numbers; conclusions are therefore tentative.\n\nClinical pharmacogenomic implications:\n- EFV:\n  - CYP2B6*6 is a consistent risk factor for EFV-induced hepatotoxicity in African cohorts.\n  - This parallels known CYP2B6\u2013EFV PK relationships (slow metabolizers have higher EFV levels and more CNS toxicity; here also higher DILI risk).\n  - In settings where EFV is still used, pre-emptive CYP2B6 genotyping could support avoiding EFV or using alternative regimens in *6 carriers, especially homozygotes, and could justify closer liver function monitoring.\n\n- NVP:\n  - CYP2B6*6 appears protective against clinically defined NVP DILI in the limited data available.\n  - If validated, genotyping might not be used to *exclude* NVP in *6 carriers; however, due to small sample sizes and conflicting mechanistic data, routine decision-making based solely on CYP2B6 for NVP cannot currently be recommended.\n  - Additional genes (e.g., CYP3A4/5, HLA alleles, other metabolizing/transport genes) need to be integrated into multi-gene risk models.\n\n- Across NNRTIs and ARVs generally:\n  - UGT1A1, CYP2B6, ABCB1, and selected HLA alleles are repeatedly implicated in ARVDILI.\n  - Network analyses emphasize that ARVDILI is a multi-gene xenobiotic metabolism phenomenon rather than a single-gene effect; polygenic and pathway-based approaches are warranted.\n\nStrengths:\n- First dedicated systematic review and meta-analysis specifically focusing on CYP2B6 and NNRTI-induced liver injury in PLHIV.\n- Rigorous selection and quality assessment, excluding studies with significant confounding or weak methodology.\n- Use of PPI/KEGG analysis to prioritize pharmacogenes within a broader ARVDILI gene set.\n- Consistent direction and magnitude of effect estimates for EFV across all included African studies, with no heterogeneity.\n\nLimitations:\n- Language restriction to English introduces potential selection bias.\n- Number of included studies and ARVDILI cases is small, particularly for NVP (only 38 cases, 2 studies), limiting power and precision.\n- All EFV studies were in African populations; NVP studies in African and one Italian cohort. Results may not generalize to populations with different CYP2B6 allele frequencies or different background comorbidities.\n- DILI definitions varied across studies (CIOMS vs RUCAM; some older vs newer criteria); these differences can influence case classification.\n- Only CYP2B6 was meta-analyzed; other important genes (e.g., UGT1A1, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB1, CYP3A4/5) were not quantitatively synthesized.\n- PPI-based prioritization does not itself prove causal relevance; it simply suggests network centrality.\n\nAuthors\u2019 conclusions:\n- Among genes evaluated for ARVDILI, UGT1A1, CYP2B6 and ABCB1 are most frequently studied; PPI data point to CYP2B6 as a central node in xenobiotic metabolism.\n- CYP2B6*6 significantly increases the risk of EFV-induced liver injury in PLHIV, while CYP2B6*1/*6 (and *1/*6 + *6/*6) are associated with a significantly lower risk of NVP-induced liver injury.\n- These findings support CYP2B6 genotyping as a candidate tool for NNRTI selection and monitoring strategies in PLHIV, especially for EFV.\n- Larger, ethnically diverse, well-phenotyped studies incorporating multiple pharmacogenes and standardized DILI criteria are needed before robust clinical decision algorithms can be finalized.\n\nFor practical PGx use:\n- EFV: CYP2B6*6 carriers (especially *6/*6) should be considered at elevated risk of hepatotoxicity and may benefit from EFV dose reduction, alternative regimens, or enhanced LFT monitoring, consistent with current EFV PGx literature.\n- NVP: Do not yet rely on CYP2B6 alone for decision-making; consider it exploratory until replicated in larger, multi-ethnic cohorts and integrated with CYP3A4/5 and HLA markers.\n\nOverall, the paper consolidates current evidence that CYP2B6 genotype is an important determinant of NNRTI-related liver injury risk, underscores drug-specific and pathway-specific differences between EFV and NVP, and provides a framework for subsequent pharmacogenomic implementation studies in HIV treatment.\n",

    "summary": "This is a single\u2010patient pharmacogenomic case report describing severe thiopurine toxicity due to NUDT15 deficiency and using the case to argue for broader, ancestry\u2011informed genotyping before thiopurine therapy.\n\nA 41\u2011year\u2011old South Asian woman with high\u2011risk acute promyelocytic leukemia achieved molecular remission after standard induction and consolidation with ATRA/ATO\u2011based regimens. She then started maintenance therapy with ATRA, low\u2011dose oral methotrexate, and mercaptopurine every 3 weeks.\n\nAbout seven weeks into maintenance, she developed profound fatigue, bruising, recurrent menorrhagia, mucositis, extensive alopecia, and petechiae. Lab tests showed life\u2011threatening pancytopenia (Hb 60 g/L, WBC 0.9 \u00d7 10^9/L, platelets 4 \u00d7 10^9/L, ANC 0), and hepatotoxicity with elevated ALT and ALP. Infectious, nutritional, endocrine, and hemolysis work\u2011ups were unrevealing. Bone marrow biopsy was markedly hypocellular (<10%) without evidence of APL relapse.\n\nGiven the timing with thiopurine exposure and absence of alternative causes, mercaptopurine toxicity was suspected. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed normal TPMT but homozygous NUDT15*3/*3 (c.415C>T), a complete loss\u2011of\u2011function genotype. This established NUDT15\u2011deficient thiopurine toxicity as the etiology of the severe myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and alopecia. Methotrexate was considered a less likely primary driver. Mercaptopurine was stopped; the patient received transfusions, G\u2011CSF, and supportive care. She showed slow hematologic recovery and remained transfusion\u2011dependent for several weeks. Mercaptopurine was permanently discontinued.\n\nThe discussion reviews thiopurine pharmacology: 6\u2011mercaptopurine, azathioprine, and thioguanine are converted intracellularly to cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), which induce lymphocyte apoptosis by inhibiting purine synthesis, DNA/RNA synthesis, and Rac1. TPMT and NUDT15 inactivate TGNs\u2014TPMT by S\u2011methylation, NUDT15 by hydrolyzing cytotoxic triphosphate forms to monophosphates. Loss\u2011of\u2011function variants in either gene decrease inactivation, increase TGN accumulation, and greatly raise the risk of myelosuppression and other toxicities, often even at \u226590% dose reductions.\n\nThe authors contrast TPMT and NUDT15:\n- TPMT variants (*2, *3A, *3C, *3B) explain >90\u201395% of TPMT poor/intermediate metabolizers in most populations and are widely used to guide thiopurine dosing. Randomized data in IBD show that pretreatment TPMT testing plus dose adjustment reduces hematologic adverse events approximately 10\u2011fold in variant carriers.\n- In contrast, in Asians and Hispanics, thiopurine toxicity is often not explained by TPMT but by NUDT15*3, which is substantially more frequent in these groups. Homozygous NUDT15*3 patients tolerate only about 8% of the standard mercaptopurine dose before toxicity, similar in severity to TPMT poor metabolizers.\n\nFrequency data cited illustrate this ancestry effect: roughly 21% of Asians/Hispanics carry one loss\u2011of\u2011function NUDT15 allele and ~2% carry two, compared with ~10% and 0.3% respectively for TPMT loss\u2011of\u2011function in Europeans/Africans. Despite this, many clinical guidelines (especially in IBD from North America and Europe) recommend TPMT testing while giving limited or no guidance on NUDT15 testing. In contrast, pediatric ALL protocols routinely require both TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping, and several Asian IBD guidelines prioritize NUDT15 over TPMT.\n\nThe case also reinforces that alopecia can be an early, sometimes sentinel, sign of thiopurine overexposure. While initially associated predominantly with NUDT15 variants, newer data suggest severe hair loss can occur even without NUDT15 mutations, but in NUDT15\u2011deficient patients it often appears early and may precede frank marrow suppression or organ injury. Recognizing rapid or pronounced alopecia under thiopurines should prompt urgent evaluation and consideration of drug cessation plus pharmacogenetic testing.\n\nClinically, the authors conclude:\n- NUDT15*3/*3 confers extreme thiopurine sensitivity with a high risk of life\u2011threatening pancytopenia and organ toxicity, even with major dose reductions; thiopurines are generally best avoided.\n- Incorporating both TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping into pretreatment assessment\u2014particularly in Asian and Hispanic patients\u2014would improve safety and the yield of pharmacogenetic testing.\n- Guidelines should explicitly integrate population\u2011specific allele frequencies to inform which pharmacogenes to test and when.\n\nOverall, the report emphasizes that thiopurine pharmacogenomics must go beyond TPMT alone and be tailored to ancestry and clinical context, and that early signs such as alopecia should trigger prompt intervention.\n",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThe authors asked whether CYP2D6 genotype and, more importantly, directly measured endoxifen concentrations are associated with breast cancer recurrence in Asian women on adjuvant tamoxifen. This was an exploratory pharmacogenomic substudy nested within a randomized trial of adjuvant hormonal therapy in the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nPopulation and methods:\n- 224 Vietnamese and Filipino women with operable, hormone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer, all undergoing surgical oophorectomy and receiving tamoxifen 20 mg/day.\n- Blood samples collected \u22654 months after starting tamoxifen (steady state) for:\n  - CYP2D6 genotyping (*1, *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *10, *41).\n  - Measurement of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen (NDM-TAM), endoxifen, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen by LC\u2013MS/MS.\n- CYP2D6 phenotypic groups: normal (fully functional *1/*2), intermediate (reduced activity; typically one reduced-function allele such as *10 or *41), and slow (two reduced-function and/or null alleles).\n- Nested case\u2013control: 24 women with recurrence matched to 24 without recurrence (same hospital, stage I\u2013II vs III, and similar enrollment date; controls had at least as long follow\u2011up as the cases). Stratified Cox regression was used to model recurrence as a function of endoxifen.\n\nKey pharmacogenomic findings:\n1. CYP2D6 allele and genotype distribution\n- Very high prevalence of CYP2D6*10 (reduced function): 58.5% in Vietnamese and 52.4% in Filipinos.\n- Normal function alleles *1 and *2 together accounted for ~35% of alleles in Vietnamese and ~42% in Filipinos.\n- Null alleles (*3\u2013*6) were rare.\n\n2. CYP2D6 genotype \u2192 endoxifen levels\n- Endoxifen showed wide inter-patient variability.\n- Mean \u00b1 SD endoxifen (ng/mL):\n  - Normal metabolizers: 48.2 \u00b1 39.7\n  - Intermediate: 39.3 \u00b1 26.6\n  - Slow: 25.0 \u00b1 22.3\n- Highly significant gene\u2013dose trend: normal > intermediate > slow (p < 0.0001).\n- CYP2D6 genotype explained only about 10% of inter-individual variance in endoxifen (r\u00b2 \u2248 0.086), consistent with prior work showing that most variability is not captured by CYP2D6 alone.\n- CYP2D6 was only weakly related to tamoxifen, NDM-TAM, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen levels, as expected given their more complex biotransformation pathways.\n\nAssociation of endoxifen levels with recurrence:\n- Contrary to the dominant hypothesis (that low endoxifen causes higher recurrence), the data suggested a J-shaped relationship:\n  - A quadratic term for endoxifen (deviation from mean squared) in a Cox model stratified by matched pair was significantly associated with recurrence (likelihood ratio p = 0.002).\n  - Among those with very low endoxifen (< ~20 ng/mL), in 8 of 9 matched pairs the recurrent case had *lower* endoxifen than its control\u2014consistent with potential risk at very low levels.\n  - At high endoxifen levels (> ~70 ng/mL), recurrences also clustered. About 25% of recurrences had endoxifen >70 ng/mL, and in recurrences with very high levels, matched controls consistently had much lower concentrations.\n- Overall, the pattern suggested an \u201coptimal\u201d therapeutic endoxifen range, with possible increased recurrence risk both at the low and the high ends (J-shaped curve), and particularly an unexpected signal for increased risk above ~70 ng/mL.\n\nInterpretation and implications:\n- CYP2D6 genotype is significantly associated with endoxifen exposure in this Filipino/Vietnamese cohort, but explains only a modest fraction of variability; many other genetic and non-genetic factors likely contribute.\n- Measured endoxifen concentration appears more directly informative about tamoxifen pharmacodynamics than CYP2D6 genotype alone.\n- The novel observation is that very high endoxifen levels (>70 ng/mL) may be associated with *higher* recurrence risk, challenging the prevailing assumption that \u201chigher is always better\u201d for endoxifen.\n- These findings raise the possibility of an optimal therapeutic window for endoxifen concentrations rather than a monotonic benefit with increasing levels, with potential implications for:\n  - Tamoxifen dose escalation strategies in CYP2D6 poor/intermediate metabolizers.\n  - Development and dosing of oral endoxifen as a therapeutic agent.\n\nLimitations:\n- Exploratory, hypothesis-generating design with a small nested case\u2013control sample (24 recurrences, 24 controls).\n- Ancillary study population is not fully representative of the parent trial (some patients declined participation).\n- Follow-up and total event numbers are limited; residual confounding and chance findings are possible.\n- The J-shaped relationship and >70 ng/mL \u201chigh-risk\u201d threshold are not yet validated and should not be used for clinical decision-making without replication.\n\nConclusion:\n- CYP2D6 genotype significantly influences endoxifen levels in Filipino and Vietnamese women on tamoxifen, but explains only a minority of variability.\n- Endoxifen concentration itself appears to be a more promising biomarker of tamoxifen effect than CYP2D6 genotype alone.\n- The data suggest an optimal endoxifen concentration range; both very low and very high levels\u2014particularly >70 ng/mL\u2014might be associated with higher risk of recurrence. These provocative findings require confirmation in larger, prospective cohorts before guiding clinical practice.\n",

CYP2B6:\n   - Genome-wide toxicogenomic panel identified two CYP2B6 SNPs (rs2054675, rs3786547) associated with rash after multiple-testing correction.\n   - Both are in strong LD with CYP2B6 516G\u2192T (rs3745274), a known reduced-function allele that increases nevirapine exposure.\n   - CYP2B6 516G\u2192T showed an allele\u2013dose effect for rash:\n     \u2022 Blacks: strong trend; 516TT vs 516GG OR \u22485.9 (95% CI 1.53\u201326.8).\n     \u2022 Whites: significant trend.\n     \u2022 Asians: weaker trend when looking directly at 516G\u2192T, but association clearer via the linked SNPs.\n   - No CYP2B6 SNPs were associated with hepatic events after correction.\n\n2. HLA class I for cutaneous events:\n   - HLA-Cw*04:\n     \u2022 Significantly associated with rash in the pooled multi-ancestry analysis; strongest effects in Blacks and Asians.\n     \u2022 OR for rash \u22482.5 in the total cohort; OR increased when excluding individuals with both rash and hepatitis.\n   - HLA-B*35:\n     \u2022 Strongly associated with rash in Asians, especially Thais:\n       \u2013 Asians overall: OR ~3.5.\n       \u2013 Thais: OR ~5.6, rising further (~7.3) when focusing only on pure cutaneous cases.\n     \u2022 No robust association in Blacks or Whites, likely due to low allele frequency.\n   - Combined risk (epistasis):\n     \u2022 Asians carrying both HLA-B*35 and HLA-Cw*04 had very high rash risk (OR ~18.3, 95% CI 5.1\u201366), indicating a strong gene\u2013gene interaction.\n\n3. CYP2B6\u2013HLA interaction for rash:\n   - Across the total cohort, risk was highest when both impaired CYP2B6 metabolism and the key HLA allele were present:\n     \u2022 CYP2B6 516TT + HLA\u2011Cw*04: OR ~6.3 vs reference (CYP2B6 516GG and no HLA\u2011Cw*04), with similar patterns in Blacks and Asians.\n   - In Blacks specifically, combined CYP2B6 516TT + HLA\u2011Cw*04 gave an OR \u224818.9 for rash (based on stratified analyses), underscoring a potent combined effect.\n\nKey genetic associations \u2013 hepatic toxicity:\n1. HLA class II for hepatic events:\n   - HLA\u2011DRB1*01:\n     \u2022 Significant association with hepatic adverse events in Whites (OR ~3.0; increases to ~3.6 when restricting to isolated hepatic cases).\n     \u2022 This allele is infrequent in Blacks and rare in Asians, so power to detect associations in those groups was low.\n   - HLA\u2011DQB1*05:\n     \u2022 Initially associated with hepatic events in Whites, but signal disappeared when the analysis was restricted to isolated hepatic events, consistent with LD with HLA\u2011DRB1*01 rather than an independent effect.\n   - No robust HLA signal for hepatic events in Blacks or Asians.\n\n2. Absence of CYP2B6 effect on liver toxicity:\n   - No CYP2B6 SNP, including 516G\u2192T, was associated with hepatic adverse events after correction.\n   - This supports a mechanistic distinction: hepatic toxicity appears not to depend on the CYP2B6-mediated kinetic profile of nevirapine.\n\nOther loci and previous candidates:\n- No SNPs in sulfotransferase/sulfatase genes (129 SNPs in 11 genes) survived correction, despite mechanistic plausibility from animal work (12-hydroxy-nevirapine sulfation \u2192 reactive metabolite in skin).\n- ABCB1 3435C\u2192T:\n  - No statistically significant association with rash or hepatotoxicity in any group after correction.\n  - In Blacks, the OR for hepatotoxicity (~0.5 for the T allele) was directionally consistent with prior African studies but underpowered.\n- HLA\u2011Cw*08:\n  - Previously linked to nevirapine hypersensitivity in Sardinia and Japan; not associated with either cutaneous or hepatic events in this multi-ancestry cohort.\n\nAncestry-specific patterns:\n- Asians (especially Thais): strong class I (HLA-B*35, HLA\u2011Cw*04)\u2013driven rash risk, with high ORs and important gene\u2013gene interactions.\n- Blacks: prominent role for CYP2B6 516G\u2192T and HLA-Cw*04 in rash; very high risk when both are present.\n- Whites: rash modestly associated with HLA-Cw*04 (weak for HLA-B*35); hepatotoxicity strongly associated with HLA-DRB1*01.\n- Differences in association patterns are partly explained by varying allele frequencies across populations.\n\nMechanistic interpretation:\n- Cutaneous toxicity:\n  - Strong association with HLA class I alleles (HLA-B*35, HLA-Cw*04) plus CYP2B6 loss-of-function suggests an MHC class I\u2013restricted, CD8 T\u2011cell\u2013mediated hypersensitivity mechanism modulated by nevirapine biotransformation.\n  - CYP2B6 516G\u2192T may alter the balance between parent drug and reactive metabolites (e.g., 12\u2011hydroxy nevirapine \u2192 sulfate \u2192 quinone methide), increasing the availability of neoantigenic species presented by risk HLA molecules in skin.\n\n- Hepatic toxicity:\n  - Dominant association with HLA-DRB1*01 (class II) and lack of CYP2B6 effect indicates a distinct, MHC class II\u2013restricted, CD4 T\u2011cell\u2013driven immunopathogenesis that does not depend on CYP2B6-mediated kinetics.\n  - Consistent with prior Australian data linking HLA\u2011DRB1*0101 to nevirapine-related hepatic/systemic hypersensitivity.\n\nClinical variables:\n- Matching on CD4 count, sex, and race prevented evaluation of those factors as independent predictors.\n- In multivariable models adjusting for HLA-Cw*04 and CYP2B6 516G\u2192T, the only clinical predictor of rash was prior ART exposure (OR ~0.57 for ART-experienced vs na\u00efve), suggesting somewhat lower rash risk in treatment-experienced patients.\n- Prior abacavir exposure in Whites was weakly protective against rash, independent of HLA/CYP2B6, but this was exploratory and may reflect selection or survivor bias.\n\nSensitivity and clinical utility of pharmacogenetic screening:\n- Despite convincingly significant associations and large ORs in some strata, the overall sensitivity of the identified variants is too low for routine clinical use:\n  - ~80% of Asians with rash were HLA\u2011B*35 negative.\n  - ~62% of all rash cases were HLA\u2011Cw*04 negative.\n  - ~56% of White hepatic cases lacked HLA\u2011DRB1*01.\n  - ~48% of all adverse event cases carried none of the key HLA risk alleles (HLA\u2011Cw*04, HLA\u2011B*35, HLA\u2011DRB1*01) and were not CYP2B6 516TT.\n- These markers would fail to identify most patients destined to develop serious nevirapine toxicity and thus are not suitable as stand-alone pre-prescription screening tools, in contrast to HLA\u2011B*57:01 for abacavir.\n\nLimitations:\n- Retrospective case identification and exclusion of mild or ambiguous events limit generalizability to moderate toxicity and preclude assessment of fatal cases.\n- CD4-based matching means the study cannot re-evaluate the well-known CD4 threshold effect.\n- High CD4 eligibility (>150 cells/\u00b5L) restricts extrapolation to patients with advanced immunosuppression.\n- HLA typed at intermediate resolution; high-resolution typing might refine specific alleles/haplotypes and ORs, but is unlikely to substantially improve sensitivity.\n- Focused on MHC and ADME genes; other immune, inflammatory, or liver injury pathways were not systematically interrogated.\n\nOverall conclusions and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- Both drug metabolism (CYP2B6) and immune recognition (HLA) influence risk of nevirapine-associated severe cutaneous and hepatic adverse events, with distinct genetic architectures and mechanisms for skin versus liver injury.\n- Cutaneous reactions appear to be:\n  - Predominantly MHC class I\u2013mediated (HLA-B*35, HLA\u2011Cw*04),\n  - Modulated by CYP2B6 516G\u2192T (altered nevirapine metabolism),\n  - Strongly shaped by ancestry-specific allele distributions.\n- Hepatic reactions appear to be:\n  - Predominantly MHC class II\u2013mediated (HLA\u2011DRB1*01, and linked HLA\u2011DQB1*05),\n  - Largely independent of CYP2B6 genotype and, by implication, parent drug exposure.\n- From a clinical standpoint, existing CD4-based prescribing restrictions likely remain more impactful than any available pharmacogenetic test for nevirapine hypersensitivity. The identified variants are mechanistically informative but, because of poor sensitivity, do not justify routine pre-treatment genetic screening.\n- Future work should seek additional risk variants (likely outside classical MHC/ADME loci), integrate multi-allelic risk scores, and elucidate specific drug\u2013HLA\u2013peptide interactions underlying these reactions.\n",

    "summary": "Study aim and design:\nProspective cohort of 50 Syrian coronary artery disease patients undergoing PCI and treated with dual antiplatelet therapy including a routinely prescribed doubled maintenance clopidogrel dose (150 mg/day, for \u22651 month). CYP2C19*2, *3, and *17 were genotyped by PCR\u2013Sanger sequencing; predicted phenotypes were assigned per 2022 CPIC guidelines. Patients were followed for 18\u201324 months for recurrent ischemic events (refractory angina, MACE) and bleeding.\n\nCYP2C19 genotype/phenotype distribution in Syrians:\n- Allele frequencies: *2 = 8%, *3 = 0%, *17 = 17%; *10, *22, *26, *33 all 0.\n- Genotypes: one *2/*2 (2%); *1/*2 = 12%; *1/*17 = 26%; *17/*17 = 4%; remaining *1/*1.\n- Predicted phenotypes: normal metabolizer (NM) 56%, intermediate metabolizer (IM) 26%, rapid metabolizer (RM) 12%, ultrarapid metabolizer (UM) 4%, poor metabolizer (PM, *2/*2) 2%.\n- Genotype frequencies were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium.\n- The allele pattern is broadly similar to other Middle East/North Africa and European populations, and distinct from East Asian populations (higher *2, *3, lower *17 in East Asia).\n\nClinical outcomes (41 patients with follow-up data):\n- Refractory angina: 16/41 (39%).\n- Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, e.g., MI, stroke, death): 2/41 (4.9%).\n- Bleeding events: 4/41 (9.8%).\n\nImpact of CYP2C19*2 on efficacy at double dose:\n- Among *2 carriers (all IM; *1/*2 or *2/*2) vs non-carriers:\n  - Refractory angina: 33.3% vs 38.9% (P > 0.9999).\n  - MACE: 16.7% vs 2.86% (P = 0.2744).\n- No statistically significant association between *2 carrier status and recurrent angina or MACE in patients receiving 150 mg/day.\n- Authors interpret this as consistent with the possibility that increasing the maintenance dose to 150 mg/day may partially overcome loss-of-function (*2)\u2013related hyporesponsiveness in this small cohort, in line with DPWG suggestions for IMs\u2014but they emphasize that the data are underpowered and exploratory.\n\nImpact of CYP2C19*17 on bleeding at double dose:\n- *17 carriers vs non-carriers:\n  - Bleeding: 16.7% vs 6.9% (P = 0.567).\n- Trend toward more bleeding in *17 carriers, but not statistically significant.\n- No clear relationship of *2 with bleeding either (33.3% vs 5.7%, P = 0.0952), likely reflecting very small numbers.\n\nNon-genetic factors:\n- Sex, BMI category, hypertension, diabetes, PPI use, and calcium channel blocker use showed no statistically significant association with refractory angina or MACE, again with wide uncertainty due to small sample size.\n\nPharmacogenomic and clinical implications:\n- This is the first detailed description of CYP2C19*2, *3, and *17 frequencies in Syrian CAD/PCI patients.\n- The absence of a detectable *2\u2013MACE association under a double clopidogrel dose contrasts with strong evidence at the standard 75 mg/day dose, and supports\u2014but does not prove\u2014the dose-escalation strategy for IMs in this population.\n- The relatively high *17 frequency (17%) and low observed bleeding rate (<10% overall, ~17% in *17 carriers) suggest that, in this small sample, double dosing was not obviously unsafe in gain-of-function carriers, but the study is too small to rule out clinically meaningful bleeding risk.\n- Authors stress major limitations: very small cohort, only 41 patients with outcome data, relatively short and telephone-based follow-up, no platelet function testing, no assessment of other relevant pharmacogenes (e.g., ABCB1, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, PON1, CES1), and possible adherence/misclassification issues.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nFor Syrian PCI patients, CYP2C19*2 and *17 frequencies resemble other MENA/European populations. In those treated with a doubled maintenance clopidogrel dose (150 mg/day), *2 carrier status did not correlate with more ischemic events, and *17 carrier status did not significantly correlate with more bleeding, suggesting that higher dosing may attenuate genotype-driven variability. However, due to the very limited sample size and event counts, the results are hypothesis-generating; larger, genotype-guided, and platelet-function\u2013informed trials in Syrian and regional populations are needed to define optimal clopidogrel dosing or selection of alternative P2Y12 inhibitors by CYP2C19 genotype.\n\nFor pharmacogenomics practice:\n- The data support implementing CYP2C19 genotyping in Syria to characterize population risk and to guide antiplatelet strategy, but they do not yet justify changing current international guideline-based approaches.\n- Existing CPIC/DPWG/RNPGx recommendations (alternative P2Y12 inhibitor for IM/PM; consider dose escalation only in specific contexts) remain the more robust evidence base; this study provides supportive local population data but not definitive outcome evidence.\n",

    "summary": "Study question and design:\n- Prospective cohort of 542 Chinese adults with primary hyperlipidemia treated with simvastatin 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks after a 7\u201310 day washout.\n- Aim: evaluate whether two common SLCO1B1 variants, 388A>G (rs2306283) and 521T>C (rs4149056), and their haplotypes are associated with (1) baseline liver function (ALT, AST), (2) baseline lipids, and (3) short-term lipid-lowering response to simvastatin.\n\nGenotyping and measurements:\n- SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C genotyped by PCR\u2013RFLP.\n- Fasting ALT, AST, TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8.\n- Minor allele frequencies: 388G = 0.28, 521C = 0.11; both SNPs in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nKey pharmacogenomic findings \u2013 hepatic function:\n1) 388A>G and baseline ALT/AST\n- 388AA homozygotes had significantly higher mean ALT and AST than 388AG/GG carriers.\n  \u2022 Dominant model (AA vs AG+GG), adjusted for age, BMI, alcohol, smoking:\n    - ALT: AA higher by ~6.1 U/L (P = 0.037).\n    - AST: AA higher by ~5.3 U/L (P = 0.002).\n- When ALT and AST were dichotomized at \u2265 40 U/L:\n  \u2022 Those in the abnormal ALT group (\u2265 40 U/L) were significantly less likely to carry the 388G allele (AG or GG): adjusted OR for AG+GG vs AA = 0.4 (95% CI 0.2\u20130.9), consistent with AA being enriched among patients with elevated ALT.\n  \u2022 Similar pattern for AST: adjusted OR for AG+GG vs AA = 0.5 (95% CI 0.2\u20131.0).\n- Interpretation: the 388A allele, particularly in AA homozygotes, is associated with higher liver enzymes, while the G allele appears protective against ALT/AST elevation in this hyperlipidemic Chinese cohort.\n\n2) 521T>C alone and baseline liver tests\n- No significant association between 521T>C genotypes and baseline ALT or AST in unadjusted or adjusted models.\n\n3) 388A>G \u00d7 521T>C interaction\n- Joint analysis (reference = carriers of 388G and 521C [GG/AG + CC/TC]):\n  \u2022 Patients with 388AA + 521TT had significantly higher ALT and AST than reference, even after adjustment:\n    - ALT: \u03b2 \u2248 +2.6 U/L (P = 0.001).\n    - AST: \u03b2 \u2248 +2.0 U/L (P = 0.001).\n- Suggests a gene\u2013gene interaction where the combination of 388AA and 521TT confers the highest liver enzyme levels.\n\n4) Haplotype analysis (388A>G\u2013521T>C) and liver enzymes\n- SNPs in strong LD (D\u2032 = 0.882).\n- Compared normal vs abnormal ALT or AST groups:\n  \u2022 The \u201chigh-enzyme\u201d groups (ALT \u2265 40 or AST \u2265 40 U/L) had:\n    - Higher frequency of 388A/521T (roughly 35\u201336% vs 26\u201327%; P \u2248 0.04 and 0.007).\n    - Lower frequency of 388G/521T (\u2248 54% vs 62%; P \u2248 0.04 and 0.032).\n  \u2022 388G/521C (haplotype *15) frequencies were similar between groups.\n- Interpretation: haplotype 388A/521T is enriched in patients with elevated ALT/AST, while haplotype 388G/521T is relatively protective.\n\nKey pharmacogenomic findings \u2013 baseline lipids:\n- 388A>G:\n  \u2022 After multivariable adjustment, 388AA carriers had modestly but significantly higher baseline HDL-C than AG/GG combined (\u03b2 \u2248 +0.14 mmol/L; P = 0.049).\n  \u2022 No significant differences for baseline TC, LDL-C, or TG by 388A>G genotype.\n- 521T>C:\n  \u2022 No significant association with baseline lipid parameters (data not shown in detail).\n\nKey pharmacogenomic findings \u2013 simvastatin response:\n- All subjects received simvastatin 20 mg/day.\n- After 4 weeks:\n  \u2022 Participants carrying the 388G allele with 521TT genotype had greater TC and LDL-C reductions than those with 388G plus 521C (TC and LDL-C reductions significantly larger; details in Supplemental Table 3).\n  \u2022 This is consistent with functional data:\n    - 388G increases OATP1B1 transport activity, fostering hepatic uptake of statin.\n    - 521C reduces OATP1B1 activity, associated with higher circulating drug but paradoxically less LDL-C lowering in some studies.\n  \u2022 Thus, the \u201chigh-activity\u201d combination (388G + 521TT) appears to confer stronger early lipid-lowering response to simvastatin.\n- After 8 weeks:\n  \u2022 No significant differences in lipid-lowering effect by either SNP or their haplotypes.\n  \u2022 Echoes other reports (pravastatin, simvastatin) where early genotype-dependent differences attenuate over longer treatment duration.\n\nSafety / CK findings:\n- CK increased overall after 4 and 8 weeks of simvastatin.\n- No significant association of 388A>G or 521T>C with CK elevations in this cohort (supplemental data), in contrast to some Western data linking 521C to myopathy.\n\nAuthors\u2019 mechanistic interpretation:\n- OATP1B1 transports bile acids and influences hepatic lipid handling.\n- 388AA\u2013521TT and haplotype 388A/521T may lead to higher bile acid levels and enhanced fatty acid absorption, potentially promoting hepatic steatosis and ALT/AST elevation.\n- 388G/521T may reduce bile acid levels, decrease hepatic fatty acid uptake, and protect against fatty liver\u2013associated aminotransferase elevation.\n- For statin efficacy, increased OATP1B1 transport (388G with intact 521T) promotes hepatic uptake of simvastatin, enhancing LDL-C lowering early in therapy.\n\nLimitations noted by authors:\n- No assessment of fatty liver status (imaging or biopsy); cannot directly link genotypes \u2192 steatosis \u2192 ALT/AST.\n- Bile acid levels were not measured; mechanistic interpretation is inferential.\n- Modest sample, particularly few 521CC homozygotes, limiting power.\n\nClinical pharmacogenomic implications:\n- In Chinese hyperlipidemic patients, SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C variants and their haplotypes are associated with:\n  \u2022 Baseline ALT/AST: 388AA and haplotype 388A/521T linked to higher enzymes; 388G/521T appears protective.\n  \u2022 Baseline HDL-C: 388AA associated with slightly higher HDL-C.\n  \u2022 Early (4-week) lipid response to simvastatin: greater TC and LDL-C reduction in 388G + 521TT carriers vs 521C carriers; effect not sustained at 8 weeks.\n- These data support a role for SLCO1B1 genotyping (beyond the well-known 521T>C myopathy risk allele) in predicting liver enzyme profile and short-term simvastatin response in East Asian populations, but replication and integration with hepatic imaging and bile acid phenotyping are needed before routine clinical implementation.\n\nTitle:\"Associations of the SLCO1B1 Polymorphisms With Hepatic Function, Baseline Lipid Levels, and Lipid-lowering Response to Simvastatin in Patients With Hyperlipidemia\"\n\nPMID: 30336686\n\nPMCID: PMC6714829",

    "summary": "Objective:\nTo explain why multiple HLA class I and II alleles are associated with cutaneous nevirapine (NVP) hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) and to identify the structural features of HLA peptide\u2011binding grooves that drive risk or protection across ancestries.\n\nDesign and methods:\n- Case\u2013control study of 151 HIV\u20111\u2013infected patients with severe cutaneous NVP HSR (grade 3/4 rash) and 413 NVP\u2011tolerant controls from African, Asian, European and Hispanic populations.\n- High\u2011resolution (4\u2011digit) HLA typing at HLA-A, -B, -C and HLA-DRB1.\n- Statistical analyses included ethnicity\u2011adjusted and ancestry\u2011stratified logistic regression.\n- Rather than testing each allele independently, alleles were grouped by:\n  - Known HLA supertypes.\n  - Structural motifs of the peptide\u2011binding pockets (class I: pockets A\u2013F; class II: P1, P4, P6, P7, P9).\n  - Functional clustering of peptide\u2011binding specificity using MHCcluster.\n- Molecular docking using crystal structures of HLA-C*04:01, HLA-B*15:01, and HLA-DRB1*01:01 to explore likely NVP binding sites.\n- For HLA-DRB1*01:01, extensive peptide elution (LC\u2011MS/MS) and binding assays \u00b1 NVP were used to see if NVP alters the peptide repertoire or binding affinity.\n- Multivariable models incorporated both HLA clusters and CYP2B6 slow\u2011metabolizer genotypes, previously shown to raise NVP exposure.\n\nKey results:\n\n1. Primary HLA-C risk cluster: shared F pocket\n- At the single\u2011allele level, HLA-C*04:01 is the only consistent, significant risk allele across all ancestries for severe cutaneous NVP HSR (overall OR \u22483.1; ethnicity\u2011adjusted p \u224810\u207b\u2074; similar ORs in Asians, Caucasians and Africans).\n- Additional ancestry\u2011specific HLA-C risk alleles were identified:\n  - HLA-C*05:01 in Caucasians (OR \u22482.7\u20132.8).\n  - HLA-C*18:01 in Africans (increased OR; borderline significance due to small N).\n- When HLA-C alleles were grouped by peptide\u2011binding pocket sequences, the strongest association was a cluster defined by a specific F pocket motif shared by:\n  - HLA-C*04:01, *04:03, *04:06, *04:07\n  - HLA-C*05:01, *05:09\n  - HLA-C*18:01\n  These alleles share a conserved F pocket sequence (Asp74\u2013Asn77\u2013Lys80\u2013Leu81\u2013Tyr84\u2013Leu95\u2013Arg97\u2013Asn114\u2013Phe116\u2013Tyr123\u2013Trp133\u2013Thr143\u2013Lys146\u2013Trp147).\n- In multivariable models adjusted for ethnicity and metabolism:\n  - HLA-C*04:01 carriage: OR 4.1 (95% CI 2.4\u20136.9).\n  - Other risk F\u2011pocket HLA\u2011C alleles: OR 2.9 (1.6\u20135.2).\n- The effect could not be explained simply by higher HLA-C surface expression; when the HLA-C F\u2011pocket risk cluster was included, imputed expression level lost significance.\n\nMechanistic inference for HLA-C:\n- Docking of NVP into the HLA-C*04:01 crystal structure indicated preferred binding in either the B pocket (near position 99) or the F pocket; the F pocket signal is consistent with the strongest statistical association.\n- A key shared residue among risk HLA-C alleles is Arg156, which in the HLA-C*04:01\u2013peptide structure stabilizes the central peptide region (P3) and can act as an alternative N\u2011terminal anchor.\n- Proposed model: in risk HLA-C alleles, NVP docks within or near the F pocket, co\u2011occupying the C\u2011terminal anchoring site with the peptide; Arg156 helps stabilize the peptide in the presence of NVP. This could generate or stabilize a disease\u2011causing HLA\u2013peptide\u2013drug complex recognized by pathogenic T cells.\n\n2. Protective HLA-B cluster: shared B pocket (B62 supertype subgroup)\n- Across HLA-B, the most prominent secondary effect was protection mediated by a specific B\u2011pocket motif, independent of HLA-C risk.\n- A characteristic B\u2011pocket sequence (Tyr7\u2013Tyr9\u2013Ala24\u2013Val34\u2013Met/Thr45\u2013Glu63\u2013Ile66\u2013Ser67\u2013Asn70\u2013Tyr/Phe99) defined a protective cluster of B62 supertype alleles:\n  - HLA-B*15:01, *15:12, *15:24, *15:25, *15:27, *15:32, *15:35\n  - HLA-B*52:01\n- Carriage of this protective B62 cluster: OR ~0.18\u20130.2 (highly significant), indicating ~80% reduction in risk.\n- Other B62 alleles that differ at key B\u2011pocket residues (e.g., HLA-B*15:02, *46:01) did not confer protection.\n\nMechanistic inference for HLA-B protection:\n- Structural data for HLA-B*15:01 (B62 supertype) show a hydrophobic B pocket.\n- Docking predicts that NVP binds within this conserved hydrophobic B pocket across protective HLA-B62 alleles.\n- Possible interpretation: in individuals carrying such HLA-B alleles, NVP\u2013peptide complexes presented by HLA-B may mimic tolerated self complexes or compete with presentation by risk HLA-C molecules, functionally diverting or dampening pathogenic T\u2011cell responses.\n\n3. Secondary HLA-B risk alleles: distinct E/F pockets\n- The strongest HLA-B risk allele at the pocket level is HLA-B*35:05, defined by a unique E pocket (Ser97\u2013Asp114\u2013Trp147\u2013Val152\u2013Leu156).\n- Other B*35 alleles lack Ser97; the overall B*35 family was *not* significantly predisposing when analyzed as a group.\n- In Southeast Asians, 9/10 NVP HSR cases carrying B*35:05 also carry HLA-C*04:01, pointing to a strong haplotypic and possibly synergistic effect.\n- Additional risk clusters after adjusting for the HLA-C risk group included:\n  - HLA-B*51, B*54, B*55, B*56, B*67, B*78 (B07 supertype group) \u2013 multivariable OR \u22482.3.\n  - HLA-B*38, B*39 (B27 supertype) \u2013 multivariable OR \u22481.8.\n- These risk alleles share specific E/F pocket motifs (e.g. Leu95\u2013Arg97\u2013Asn114\u2013Phe/Lys116\u2013Val152\u2013Leu156 or Trp95\u2013Thr97\u2013Asn114\u2013Phe/Leu/Tyr116\u2013Val/Glu152\u2013Leu156), supporting the idea that particular E/F pocket chemistries predispose to NVP HSR.\n\n4. HLA-DRB1 risk cluster: shared P4 pocket\n- A secondary risk cluster at HLA-DRB1 was identified, composed of DR1 and DR4 supertypes:\n  - HLA-DRB1*01:01, *01:02, *01:03\n  - HLA-DRB1*04:04, *04:05, *04:08, *04:10\n- This cluster showed an overall OR ~2.0 (95% CI 1.23\u20133.24) in multivariable analysis.\n- These DRB1 risk alleles share a P4 pocket motif at \u03b2\u2011chain positions 13, 70, 71, 74 and 78: (Phe/His)13\u2013Gln70\u2013Arg71\u2013Ala74\u2013Tyr78.\n- By contrast, HLA-DRB1*04:01 and *04:15 (common in Caucasians) differ only at \u03b271 (Lys instead of Arg) and appear protective (significantly enriched in controls vs cases), implicating \u03b271 as a key determinant.\n\nMechanistic inference for HLA-DRB1:\n- \u03b271 in the P4 pocket of DRB1 is known to influence both peptide specificity and the orientation of bound peptides, thereby altering TCR recognition in autoimmune diseases.\n- In this study:\n  - Peptide elution from HLA-DRB1*01:01 single\u2011antigen cell lines \u00b1 NVP showed no major shift in repertoire: similar peptide lengths and similar anchor usage at P1 and P9; small apparent differences at P4/P6 were not statistically significant.\n  - In vitro binding assays \u00b1 NVP revealed no effect of NVP on peptide binding affinity to HLA-DRB1*01:01.\n  - Docking predicted only weak NVP interaction (\u20136.1 kcal/mol) with HLA-DRB1*01:01 in the presence of peptide, making direct binding within the DR groove unlikely.\n- Thus, for class II, the data do *not* support an abacavir\u2011like mechanism of drug-induced peptide repertoire change. The authors suggest more indirect possibilities: tissue\u2011restricted peptide changes, drug effects at the TCR interface, or interactions with peptide\u2013HLA complexes not captured in the in vitro system.\n\n5. Integration with CYP2B6 and ancestry\n- CYP2B6 slow-metabolizer genotypes remained an independent risk factor (overall OR \u22482.1), consistent with higher NVP exposure contributing to HSR risk.\n- When HLA-C risk cluster, HLA-B risk/protective clusters, HLA-DRB1 risk cluster, and CYP2B6 were all included, effect sizes were comparable across African, Asian, and Caucasian groups despite very different allele frequencies.\n- No strong evidence for a single dominant chromosome 6p haplotype beyond the B*35:05\u2013C*04:01 haplotype in SE Asians; rather, structurally similar pockets across different alleles and backgrounds explain multi\u2011ethnic risk.\n\nConceptual advance:\n- Instead of treating each HLA allele independently, the study demonstrates that *structurally and functionally defined pockets* in the peptide\u2011binding groove (particularly the class I F and B pockets and class II P4 pocket) better explain the complex pattern of NVP HSR associations across ancestries.\n- The primary predisposition is attributable to a shared HLA-C F pocket architecture (plus Arg156), which likely accommodates NVP together with specific peptides and drives pathogenic CD8\u207a T\u2011cell responses.\n- Secondary modulation occurs via:\n  - Protective HLA-B B62 alleles with a shared hydrophobic B pocket, apparently binding NVP in a way that reduces risk.\n  - Additional HLA-B alleles with specific E/F pocket motifs that increase risk.\n  - HLA-DRB1 alleles with a shared P4 pocket signature that influence CD4\u207a T\u2011cell help, probably via peptide orientation and TCR recognition rather than direct drug binding.\n\nImplications for pharmacogenomics and clinical translation:\n- There is no single, high\u2013negative\u2011predictive\u2011value HLA allele for NVP analogous to HLA-B*57:01 for abacavir. Instead, risk is distributed over multiple structurally related alleles.\n- A pocket\u2011based framework provides a mechanistic explanation for multi\u2011allelic, multi\u2011ethnic associations and may allow prediction of risk for rare or untested alleles that share critical binding\u2011groove residues with known risk alleles.\n- The same analytical approach (grouping alleles by binding pocket chemistry and peptide\u2011binding specificity) is likely applicable to other drug HSR syndromes and autoimmune diseases where multiple HLA alleles are implicated.\n- Clinically, comprehensive screening across all risk alleles is not yet practical in most regions, and positive predictive values remain modest (many carriers will tolerate NVP). However, these data identify particularly high\u2011risk constellations (e.g. HLA-C*04:01 or F\u2011pocket cluster without protective B62 alleles; HLA-C*04:01 plus B*35:05 in Asians; co\u2011carriage of DRB1 P4\u2011risk alleles) and confirm a role for CYP2B6 slow metabolism.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nSevere cutaneous NVP hypersensitivity is primarily driven by HLA-C alleles that share a specific F\u2011pocket structure (exemplified by HLA-C*04:01), with additional modulation by protective HLA-B62 B\u2011pocket alleles, other HLA-B E/F\u2011pocket risk alleles, HLA-DRB1 P4\u2011pocket alleles, and CYP2B6\u2011mediated drug exposure. Drug\u2013peptide\u2013HLA interactions are thus governed by shared pocket chemistry rather than isolated alleles, explaining the multiplicity and ancestry\u2011spanning nature of HLA associations with NVP HSR and offering a generalizable framework for dissecting complex HLA\u2011drug interactions.\n",

    "summary": "Design and cohort:\n- Single-center retrospective pharmacogenetic study of 79 adult kidney transplant recipients transplanted 2008\u20132009, all on tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, with 12 years of follow-up.\n- Genotyped 37 SNPs in 14 ADME pharmacogenes in both donors and recipients (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, TPMT, UGT1A9, ABCB1, ABCC2, SLCO1B1, NOD2, etc.).\n- Outcomes: overall survival, de novo tumors, acute and chronic rejection, nephrotoxicity, re-transplantation, renal function (eGFR), infections, de novo diabetes, and tacrolimus dose-normalized troughs (C0/D) over time.\n- Analyses: multivariate logistic regression (all SNPs + age + sex), FDR correction, Kaplan\u2013Meier for survival/tumors, and genotype-stratified tacrolimus C0/D and eGFR curves.\n\nKey pharmacogenetic associations\n\n1) Survival (12\u2011year)\n- Donor ABCB1 rs9282564 AA: associated with reduced risk of death (OR \u2248 0.12; FDR\u2011significant). AG donors had lower Kaplan\u2013Meier survival than AA.\n- Donor ABCC2 rs2273697 GA: associated with increased death risk (OR \u2248 4.1; FDR\u2011significant). Kaplan\u2013Meier showed best survival with donor GG vs AA/GA.\n- CYP3A5 rs776746 (recipient) and CYP2B6 rs3745274 (recipient) appeared in logistic models pre\u2011FDR but did not remain FDR\u2011significant for death, though curves suggested better late survival for CYP3A5 *3/*3.\n\n2) Tumor incidence\n- Recipient CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT: associated with markedly lower tumor risk (OR \u2248 0.10, FDR\u2011significant). The variant thus appears protective against de novo malignancy.\n- Donor ABCC2 rs2273697 AA and GA: associated with higher tumor risk (AA OR \u2248 13; GA OR \u2248 3.4).\n- Donor ABCB1 rs9282564 AA: associated with lower tumor risk (OR \u2248 0.12).\n\n3) Rejection, nephrotoxicity, re\u2011transplantation (renal outcomes)\n- Chronic rejection\n  - Donor ABCB1 rs2235013 GA: protective (OR \u2248 0.13).\n\n- Acute rejection\n  - Recipient CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA: protective (OR \u2248 0.08).\n  - Recipient SLCO1B1 rs4149056 TT: protective (OR \u2248 0.16).\n  - Donor CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT: protective (OR \u2248 0.20).\n  - Donor UGT1A9 rs6714486 TA: associated with much higher acute rejection risk (OR > 30, but based on small, imbalanced numbers).\n\n- Nephrotoxicity\n  - Recipient SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AA and AG: strongly protective (OR \u2248 0.08 and 0.23, respectively); donor SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AG also protective (OR \u2248 0.11).\n  - Donor NOD2 rs2066844 CC: protective (OR \u2248 0.02), with no clear C0/D effect.\n  - Donor CYP2C19 rs4244285 AA (*2 poor metabolizer): greatly increased nephrotoxicity risk (OR \u2248 11.7), paralleling very high tacrolimus C0/D.\n\n- Re\u2011transplantation\n  - Donor TPMT rs1142345 AA and donor CYP2C9 rs1799853 CC: both associated with reduced re\u2011transplantation risk (OR \u2248 0.05 and 0.10, respectively); mechanistic basis is unclear and numbers are small.\n\n4) Diabetes and infections\n- De novo diabetes mellitus\n  - Recipient CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT: trend toward protection (OR \u2248 0.27, p = FDR threshold 0.056), consistent with lower diabetes risk but borderline.\n\n- Infections\n  - Recipient ABCB1 rs1045642 CC: reduced severe infection risk (OR \u2248 0.09).\n  - Donor ABCB1 rs9282564 AA: markedly increased infection risk (OR \u2248 23.8), despite being protective for survival and tumors\u2014suggesting complex, context\u2011dependent effects.\n\nEffects on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics (C0/D) and link to toxicity/outcomes\n\n- CYP3A4 rs2740574 (recipient)\n  - AA: substantially higher C0/D than GA across 12 years (often ~2\u2011fold difference; >200 vs ~100 ng/mL\u00b7kg/mg from year 6 onward). This is consistent with literature that *1/*1 (AA) associates with higher exposure. Higher exposure likely underlies reduced acute rejection risk and better eGFR.\n\n- CYP3A5 rs776746 (recipient and donor)\n  - *3/*3 (GG): non\u2011expressers had significantly higher C0/D (often >200 ng/mL\u00b7kg/mg) vs *1/*3 (GA), whose C0/D stayed ~100. This matches CPIC/DPWG guidance that *3/*3 requires lower starting tacrolimus doses.\n\n- CYP2C19 rs4244285 (donor)\n  - AA (*2/*2): recipients displayed very high tacrolimus C0/D (>300 ng/mL\u00b7kg/mg) from ~year 3 onward compared with GG/GA donors. This poor-metabolizer status plus co-administered omeprazole (a CYP2C19 substrate) likely shifts metabolism toward CYP3A5, saturating tacrolimus clearance and driving nephrotoxicity.\n\n- ABCB1 (recipient and donor)\n  - Recipient rs1045642 TT and rs2235033 TT: higher tacrolimus C0/D than other genotypes; consistent with decreased efflux and higher systemic exposure, which may help prevent rejection but also increase toxicity risk.\n  - Donor rs2235013 GG: lower and more stable tacrolimus C0/D (~100 ng/mL\u00b7kg/mg) in recipients.\n\n- SLCO1B1\n  - Recipient rs4149056 TT: nearly double tacrolimus C0/D vs TC from year 3 onward, aligning with reduced transporter function and protective effect against acute rejection.\n  - Donor rs2306283 AA vs GG: early post\u2011transplant significant C0/D differences, diminishing over time. AA genotypes in donors and recipients were protective against nephrotoxicity, likely via lower tissue exposure.\n\nImpact on renal function (eGFR)\n\n- Across genotypes, eGFR rose from <10 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 at transplant to ~50\u201360 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 at 1 year, with genotype\u2011dependent patterns thereafter.\n\nMetabolizing genes:\n- Recipient CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA: better early and sustained eGFR than GA (\u224860 vs 45 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2; p < 0.001), consistent with better overall exposure control.\n- Donor CYP3A5 rs776746 *3/*3: higher eGFR vs *1/*3 from 9\u201312 months onward.\n- Recipient CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT: higher eGFR compared with TT; donor TT was associated with delayed and lower eGFR recovery vs GT.\n\nTransporter genes:\n- Recipient ABCB1 rs1045642 CC: fastest and best eGFR recovery, maintained >60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2, superior to CT/TT.\n- Donor ABCC2 rs2273697 GG: consistently higher eGFR (~60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2) than other genotypes from week 1 onward, paralleling its favorable survival and low tumor risk.\n\nGene\u2013gene interactions\n\nThe study explicitly tested interactions between metabolism and transporter variants, highlighting that combined genotypes often had stronger predictive value than single SNPs:\n- ABCC2\u2013CYP2C19 (donor\u2013donor): GG at ABCC2 rs2273697 plus AG or AA at CYP2C19 rs4244285 reduced tumor risk (OR < 0.2).\n- CYP2B6\u2013ABCC2 (recipient\u2013donor): GA in CYP2B6 rs2279343 (recipient) plus GG in donor ABCC2 rs2273697 increased tumor risk (OR ~5.3).\n- CYP2B6\u2013ABCB1 (donor\u2013recipient): donor CYP2B6 rs3745274 TT plus recipient ABCB1 rs1045642 TC raised acute rejection risk; donor TT plus recipient ABCB1 rs2235033 TC increased nephrotoxicity risk (OR ~7.5).\n- CYP2B6\u2013SLCO1B1 (donor\u2013donor): donor CYP2B6 rs3745274 TT plus donor SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AG increased de novo diabetes risk (OR ~9.8).\n- CYP3A5\u2013ABCB1/SLCO1B1 (recipient\u2013donor): recipient CYP3A5 *1/*3 (GA) combined with donor ABCB1 rs2235013 GA or donor SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AG increased mortality risk (OR ~6.4).\n\nInterpretation and clinical implications\n\n- The study extends the tacrolimus pharmacogenetic evidence base beyond CYP3A5 by:\n  - Showing long-term links between known metabolism/transport SNPs (CYP3A5, CYP3A4, ABCB1, ABCC2, SLCO1B1, CYP2C19) and hard outcomes: 12\u2011year survival, tumors, nephrotoxicity, rejection, infections, and graft function.\n  - Highlighting clinically plausible mechanistic chains: variants that increase tacrolimus exposure (e.g., CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA, CYP3A5 *3/*3, SLCO1B1 rs4149056 TT, CYP2C19 *2 in the donor) associate with both beneficial (less rejection, better survival) and harmful effects (nephrotoxicity, infections, tumors) depending on the balance of under\u2011 vs over\u2011immunosuppression.\n  - Identifying previously underexplored genes (CYP2B6, SLCO1B1, ABCC2, NOD2) as potential contributors to long-term clinical evolution.\n\n- From a translational perspective:\n  - The data support pre\u2011transplant genotyping of both donor and recipient for a broad ADME panel (not only CYP3A5), particularly ABCB1, ABCC2, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, SLCO1B1, CYP2C19.\n  - For high\u2011risk genotypes (e.g., CYP2C19 *2 donors combined with omeprazole therapy, or SLCO1B1 loss\u2011of\u2011function, or unfavorable ABCC2/ABCB1 profiles), closer therapeutic drug monitoring, earlier dose adjustment, or alternative co\u2011medications may be warranted.\n  - Multi\u2011gene and gene\u2013gene interaction models may outperform single\u2011SNP approaches for predicting late complications.\n\nLimitations\n\n- Modest cohort size (n=79) and single-center, largely homogeneous population limit power and generalizability.\n- Many odds ratios have wide confidence intervals, especially for rare genotypes; some extreme ORs likely reflect small cell counts.\n- Tacrolimus exposure and clinical decisions were not prospectively guided by genotype, so causal inferences remain hypothesis\u2011generating.\n\nOverall conclusion\n\nThis 12\u2011year follow\u2011up study indicates that both donor and recipient pharmacogene variants in tacrolimus metabolism/transport pathways are associated with long-term survival, graft function, malignancy, nephrotoxicity, rejection, infections, and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in kidney transplant recipients. Findings corroborate the importance of CYP3A5 and extend relevance to CYP3A4, ABCB1, ABCC2, CYP2C19, SLCO1B1, CYP2B6 and others. Broad pre\u2011transplant pharmacogenetic testing, interpreted via multi\u2011gene models and integrated with therapeutic drug monitoring, could improve individualized immunosuppression, but larger multicenter validation is needed before routine implementation.\n",
