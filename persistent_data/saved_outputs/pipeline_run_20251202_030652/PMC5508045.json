    "summary": "Study design and population:\n- Retrospective pharmacogenomic study in 250 Thai adults on long\u2011term warfarin with stable weekly doses (SWDs) and INRs 2.0\u20133.0.\n- Collected demographic/clinical data (age, BMI, indication, co-medications, smoking) and genotyped four SNPs: VKORC1 \u22121639G>A, CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910), CYP4F2 rs2108622, and UGT1A1 rs887829.\n\nKey findings \u2013 genetic factors:\n- VKORC1 \u22121639G>A was the strongest determinant of dose:\n  - AA and GA genotypes required ~50% and ~28% lower SWDs than GG.\n  - In multivariable modeling, VKORC1 explained 26.2% of dose variance (22.5% AA, 3.7% GA).\n- CYP2C9*3 had a moderate effect:\n  - *1/*3 and *3/*3 genotypes required ~34% and ~65% lower SWDs than *1/*1.\n  - Accounted for ~6.0% of variability (3.3% *3/*3, 2.7% *1/*3), consistent with its lower allele frequency in Asians.\n- CYP4F2 rs2108622 had a modest, dose\u2011increasing effect:\n  - TT genotype associated with +4.1 mg/week vs CC in multivariable analysis.\n  - Contributed 1.2% to dose variance.\n- UGT1A1 rs887829 had no detectable impact on warfarin dose in this Thai cohort, despite prior positive reports in Koreans and Brazilians.\n\nKey findings \u2013 non\u2011genetic factors:\n- Age: strong negative relationship with dose (\u22120.25 mg/week per year; r = \u22120.33). Patients \u226560 years required significantly lower doses than those 20\u201339.\n- BMI: positive relationship with dose (+0.345 mg/week per BMI unit). Class I\u2013II obesity required ~25% higher doses than normal BMI.\n- Co\u2011medications:\n  - Amiodarone: \u22127.2 mg/week (3.0% of variance), consistent with inhibition of warfarin metabolism.\n  - Antiplatelet drugs (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor): \u22123.4 mg/week (1.0% of variance).\n- Smoking: Current smokers required ~4.0 mg/week higher doses (0.8% of variance), likely via CYP1A2 induction and increased warfarin clearance.\n- Sex, height, and UGT1A1 genotype were not significant predictors.\n\nExplained variability and model performance:\n- Stepwise multiple linear regression including VKORC1, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2 rs2108622, age, BMI, amiodarone use, antiplatelet use, and current smoking explained 51.3% of variability in stable warfarin dose.\n- Approximate contributions to R\u00b2:\n  - VKORC1 \u22121639G>A: 26.2%\n  - Age: 10.8%\n  - CYP2C9*3: 6.0%\n  - Amiodarone: 3.0%\n  - BMI: 2.3%\n  - CYP4F2 rs2108622 (TT): 1.2%\n  - Antiplatelets: 1.0%\n  - Smoking: 0.8%\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- In Thai patients, VKORC1 \u22121639G>A and CYP2C9*3 are the primary pharmacogenomic drivers of warfarin dose, with CYP4F2 rs2108622 exerting a smaller, dose\u2011increasing effect.\n- UGT1A1 rs887829 does not appear to be clinically useful for warfarin dose prediction in this population, despite mechanistic plausibility and prior positive studies in other ethnic groups.\n- Clinical factors\u2014especially age, BMI, and co\u2011treatment with amiodarone or antiplatelet agents, plus smoking status\u2014meaningfully modify warfarin requirements and should be considered alongside genotype.\n- A combined algorithm incorporating VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2 plus age, BMI, and key co\u2011medications can explain about half of warfarin dose variability in Thais; diet and other unmeasured factors likely account for much of the remainder.\n- Findings support population\u2011specific warfarin pharmacogenetic dosing approaches in Southeast Asians, emphasizing VKORC1/CYP2C9/CYP4F2 together with age and BMI, while not prioritizing UGT1A1 genotyping for warfarin.\n\nLimitations noted by authors:\n- Retrospective design; vitamin K intake and some other confounders were not controlled.\n- Relatively small numbers for some genotypes (e.g., CYP2C9*3/*3, UGT1A1 TT), limiting precision of those estimates.\n- Results may not generalize beyond Thai patients with similar clinical characteristics.\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- In Thai patients, stable warfarin dose is jointly determined by VKORC1 \u22121639G>A, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2 rs2108622 and by age, BMI, amiodarone, antiplatelet use, and smoking status, which together account for 51.3% of inter\u2011individual dose variability. UGT1A1 rs887829 is not a meaningful predictor in this population.\n\nThese data support using a warfarin dosing algorithm tailored to Thais that includes VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2 and key clinical covariates for more accurate initial and maintenance dose prediction, with a call for prospective studies to test clinical utility.\n",
