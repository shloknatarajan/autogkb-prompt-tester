    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis pharmacogenomic study evaluated how polymorphisms in drug\u2011metabolizing enzymes and transporters affect steady\u2011state simvastatin plasma concentrations in Thai patients. Eighty\u2011nine adults with dyslipidemia or coronary artery disease, taking a stable dose of simvastatin (5\u201340 mg/day) for \u22652 weeks, were recruited. Trough (12\u2011h post\u2011dose) plasma concentrations of simvastatin lactone (SVL) and simvastatin hydroxy acid (SVA) were quantified by UHPLC\u2013MS/MS and normalized by dose (Css/Dose). Ten SNPs in seven pharmacokinetic genes (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, CYP3A4, CYP3A5) were genotyped using the MassARRAY platform.\n\nKey genotypes and allele frequencies:\n- SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (rs4149056): TT 89.9%, TC 10.1%, CC 0%; C\u2011allele frequency 5.1%.\n- SLCO1B1 c.388A>G (rs2306283): AA 19.1%, AG 37.1%, GG 43.8%; G\u2011allele frequency 62.4%.\n- Other transporter and CYP variants had frequencies consistent with prior Thai data, and most were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nMain pharmacokinetic findings:\n1. SLCO1B1 c.521T>C and SVA levels\n- Carriers of the SLCO1B1 c.521 variant (TC+CC) had significantly higher dose\u2011normalized SVA trough concentrations than TT homozygotes:\n  - Median SVA Css/Dose: 0.53 vs 0.19 ng/mL (p = 0.03).\n- SVL levels did not differ significantly by c.521 genotype.\n\n2. SLCO1B1 haplotypes/diplotypes (per CPIC nomenclature)\n- Alleles considered: *1a, *1b (normal function), *5, *15 (no/loss\u2011of\u2011function components around c.521C \u00b1 c.388G).\n- Diplotypes:\n  - *1a/*1a: reference, median SVA Css/Dose 0.16 ng/mL.\n  - *1a/*1b and *1b/*1b: numerically higher but not significantly different from *1a/*1a.\n  - *1b/*15: significantly higher SVA Css/Dose than *1a/*1a (0.58 vs 0.16 ng/mL, p < 0.001).\n  - *1b/*5: rare (n=2); SVA levels low and not clearly different but underpowered.\n- When grouped by predicted OATP1B1 function (CPIC\u2011style phenotypes):\n  - Normal function (two normal\u2011function alleles: *1a/*1a, *1a/*1b, *1b/*1b) vs decreased function (*1b/*5, *1b/*15):\n    - SVA Css/Dose: 0.19 vs 0.53 ng/mL, p = 0.07 (trend toward significance).\n\n3. Dose\u2011stratified observations (exploratory):\n- At 10 mg/day (most common dose), c.521 TC+CC carriers had higher SVA than TT (5.83 vs 1.95 ng/mL, p = 0.06).\n- At 10 mg/day, SLCO1B1 c.388 AG+GG carriers had significantly higher SVA than AA (3.63 vs 1.59 ng/mL, p = 0.04).\n- No consistent dose effect was seen at 5, 20, or 40 mg, but these strata were small.\n\n4. Other PK genes:\n- No significant associations were found between SVL or SVA levels and polymorphisms in:\n  - ABCB1 rs1045642\n  - ABCC2 rs717620, rs3740066\n  - ABCG2 rs2231142\n  - SLCO1B3 rs7311158, rs4149117\n  - CYP3A4*1G rs2242480\n  - CYP3A5*3 rs776746\n- ABCC2, ABCG2, and CYP3A variants may still influence statin PK in other settings, but they were not detectable contributors to 12\u2011h steady\u2011state SVL or SVA in this cohort.\n\nMethodological notes:\n- Sampling at 12 h post\u2011dose reflects trough steady\u2011state exposure rather than full AUC or Cmax.\n- SVL LLOQ was 0.05 ng/mL; SVA LLOQ 0.2 ng/mL; assay was linear and precise within 0.05\u201350 ng/mL.\n- All SNPs had >95% call rate; most were in HWE. A multivariate analysis indicated no meaningful batch effect confounding the SLCO1B1\u2013SVA association.\n\nInterpretation and mechanistic link:\n- OATP1B1 (encoded by SLCO1B1) mediates hepatic uptake of SVA. Reduced function of OATP1B1 impairs hepatic clearance of SVA, increasing systemic exposure and thereby myotoxicity risk.\n- SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (V174A) is a functional variant that disrupts membrane localization and reduces transporter activity. In vitro data show decreased OATP1B1 expression and transport for the C allele, consistent with higher observed SVA levels.\n- The *1b/*15 diplotype combines the c.388G and c.521C variants and corresponds to a decreased/no\u2011function OATP1B1 phenotype, explaining the marked SVA elevation.\n- The findings in Thais are concordant with previous Caucasian and East Asian studies linking rs4149056 to higher SVA AUC/Cmax and to statin\u2011associated myopathy.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics and statin prescribing:\n- This is the first study directly linking pharmacokinetic gene variants to steady\u2011state simvastatin concentrations in Thai patients.\n- Key implication: SLCO1B1 genotyping (particularly rs4149056, and secondarily rs2306283 as part of haplotypes) is clinically relevant in Thailand for simvastatin therapy.\n- For carriers of c.521C or decreased\u2011function diplotypes (e.g., *1b/*15):\n  - Expect higher SVA exposure at standard simvastatin doses.\n  - This phenotype is associated, in larger external studies, with increased risk of statin\u2011induced myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.\n  - CPIC (2022) recommends using lower simvastatin doses or selecting alternative statins less dependent on OATP1B1 (e.g., pravastatin, fluvastatin, or possibly low\u2011dose rosuvastatin with ABCG2 consideration) in decreased/poor function SLCO1B1 genotypes.\n- Given simvastatin\u2019s high use and reimbursement as an essential medicine in Thailand, integrating SLCO1B1 pharmacogenetic testing could:\n  - Reduce statin\u2011induced musculoskeletal symptoms and severe myotoxicity.\n  - Help avoid unnecessary discontinuation of statins and maintain LDL\u2011C control.\n\nLimitations:\n- Modest sample size (n=89) with low frequency of c.521C carriers and no CC homozygotes or poor\u2011function (*5/*5 or *15/*15) diplotypes, limiting power.\n- Only a single trough time point was measured; AUC and Cmax were not captured.\n- Dose\u2011stratified analyses were underpowered, particularly at 5 and 40 mg.\n- Myotoxicity outcomes (e.g., clinically significant myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or CK elevations beyond modest CPK values) were not directly analyzed; links to clinical toxicity are inferred from prior literature.\n\nAuthors\u2019 conclusion:\n- In Thai patients, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C and the *1b/*15 diplotype (decreased OATP1B1 function) are significantly associated with higher steady\u2011state plasma SVA concentrations.\n- Other tested PK variants (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, SLCO1B3, CYP3A4*1G, CYP3A5*3) do not meaningfully affect SVA or SVL trough levels in this cohort.\n- These findings support the clinical value of SLCO1B1 genotyping\u2014especially rs4149056, together with rs2306283 for haplotype assignment\u2014to guide simvastatin/statin selection and dosing in Thai patients, in line with CPIC recommendations. Larger outcome\u2011oriented studies are needed to confirm the impact on statin\u2011induced myotoxicity rates in this population.",
