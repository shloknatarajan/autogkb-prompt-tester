Twenty CBZ cases and 65 controls were included in this analysis. The frequency of HLA-A*31:01 in European CBZ-tolerant children (3.1%; [Table 3](#T3)) was similar to the frequency reported previously in a European study (3.9%). Similar results were observed for the association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ hypersensitivity as for the full cohort, with 20% of CBZ cases carrying HLA-A*31:01 (OR: 7.62; P=0.025; [Table 3](#T3)).

    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis Canadian, multicenter, pediatric pharmacogenomics case\u2013control study evaluated whether HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 predict carbamazepine (CBZ) hypersensitivity in children of diverse ancestries. Forty\u2011two children with CBZ hypersensitivity (9 SJS/TEN, 6 HSS, 26 maculopapular exanthems [MPE], 1 AGEP) and 91 CBZ-tolerant controls (\u22658 weeks CBZ without reaction) were genotyped. Five oxcarbazepine (OXC) hypersensitivity cases were explored descriptively.\n\nGenotyping:\n- HLA-B*15:02 was directly typed with a commercial kit.\n- HLA-A*31:01 was assessed by sequence-based typing and by the proxy SNP rs1061235, known to be in complete LD with HLA-A*31:01 in Europeans.\n\nKey findings \u2013 HLA-A*31:01:\n- Strong association with CBZ-induced HSS:\n  - 3/6 HSS cases (50%) vs 3/91 controls (3.3%) carried HLA-A*31:01.\n  - OR 26.4; P = 0.0025.\n- Significant association with CBZ-induced MPE:\n  - 6/26 MPE cases (23.1%) vs 3/91 controls (3.3%).\n  - OR 8.6; P = 0.0037.\n- Combined HSS + MPE:\n  - 9/32 cases (28.1%) vs 3/91 controls (3.3%).\n  - OR 11.2; P = 2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2074.\n- No association with CBZ-SJS/TEN (0/9 SJS/TEN carriers of HLA-A*31:01; OR ~1, P = 1.0), though numbers were small.\n- Overall CBZ hypersensitivity (all phenotypes): 9/42 cases (21.4%) vs 3/91 controls (3.3%), OR 7.85; P = 0.0016.\n\nProxy SNP rs1061235:\n- rs1061235T also associated with HSS and MPE with similar effect sizes (combined HSS/MPE: OR 9.45; P = 2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2075).\n- rs1061235T remained overrepresented among cases even after excluding HLA-A*31:01 carriers, particularly in some non\u2011European ancestries (often tagging HLA-A*33:03), indicating that rs1061235 is not a reliable universal proxy for HLA-A*31:01 in multiethnic populations.\n\nKey findings \u2013 HLA-B*15:02:\n- Strong association with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN only:\n  - 3/9 SJS/TEN cases (33.3%) vs 1/87 genotyped controls (1.1%).\n  - OR 38.6; P = 0.0022.\n- All HLA-B*15:02\u2013positive SJS/TEN patients reported Asian ancestry (Chinese, Filipino, Sri Lankan, etc.), confirming ethnic enrichment and extending relevance to Sri Lankan origin.\n- No HLA-B*15:02 carriers among HSS or MPE cases; no association with these phenotypes.\n- Across all CBZ hypersensitivity phenotypes combined, HLA-B*15:02 was not significantly enriched due to its specificity for SJS/TEN and low allele frequency.\n\nCombined analysis:\n- Considering HLA-A*31:01 or HLA-B*15:02 as a combined test:\n  - 12/42 CBZ hypersensitivity cases (28.6%) vs 4/87\u201391 controls (\u22484\u20135%) carried at least one risk allele.\n  - Combined OR 8.14; P = 2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2074.\n  - Positive likelihood ratio \u22486.2.\n  - Assuming a baseline CBZ hypersensitivity risk of 5\u201310%, a positive test raises post-test risk to ~25\u201341%, whereas a negative test reduces it to ~3.8\u20137.7%.\n- The variants are neither necessary nor sufficient: most carriers tolerate CBZ, and some hypersensitivity cases lack both risk alleles.\n\nAncestry insights:\n- HLA-B*15:02 carriers were exclusively of Asian origin (mostly Chinese, one Filipino, one Sri Lankan), consistent with known population frequencies.\n- HLA-A*31:01 carriers were observed across multiple ancestries, including European, Aboriginal Canadian, and Latin American, confirming its broad global relevance.\n- Subgroup analysis restricted to children with predominantly European ancestry (\u22653 European grandparents) replicated the HLA-A*31:01 signal:\n  - All CBZ hypersensitivity: 4/20 cases (20%) vs 2/65 controls (3.1%), OR 7.62; P = 0.025.\n  - HSS/MPE: 4/16 (25%) vs 2/65 (3.1%), OR 10.05; P = 0.013.\n\nOXC hypersensitivity (exploratory):\n- Five OXC cases (2 SJS, 3 MPE): no clear pattern for HLA-A*31:01 or HLA-B*15:02, and sample size too small to conclude.\n\nClinical implications:\n- This is the first study to clearly demonstrate HLA-A*31:01 as a risk factor for CBZ-induced HSS and MPE in children and in a multiethnic North American setting, including European, Aboriginal, and Latin American ancestries.\n- HLA-B*15:02 is strongly and specifically associated with CBZ-SJS/TEN in pediatric patients of Asian ancestry, in line with adult data.\n- Given the severity of SJS/TEN and HSS, and the availability of alternative antiepileptic drugs, the authors advocate pre-prescription genotyping for both HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 in all children (and adults) considered for CBZ, irrespective of reported ancestry, especially in ethnically admixed populations.\n- rs1061235 should not be used alone as a universal surrogate for HLA-A*31:01 in diverse populations; direct HLA typing is preferable where possible.\n\nLimitations:\n- Modest sample size, particularly for SJS/TEN and HSS, limits precision of phenotype-specific odds ratios and may contribute to lack of observed association of HLA-A*31:01 with SJS/TEN.\n- Ancestry based on self-report without genetic confirmation, and controls skewed toward European origin.\n- No large OXC-tolerant control group to examine cross-reactivity.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nHLA-A*31:01 is a robust predictor of CBZ-induced HSS and MPE in children across multiple ancestries, while HLA-B*15:02 is a strong, specific marker for CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in Asian children. Combined HLA-A*31:01/HLA-B*15:02 testing in pediatric practice has substantial potential to reduce severe CBZ hypersensitivity, though further work is needed to refine risk prediction and clarify the role of HLA-A*31:01 in SJS/TEN and AGEP.\n",
