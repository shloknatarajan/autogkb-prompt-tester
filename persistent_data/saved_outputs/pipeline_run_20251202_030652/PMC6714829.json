    "summary": "Study question and design:\n- Prospective cohort of 542 Chinese adults with primary hyperlipidemia treated with simvastatin 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks after a 7\u201310 day washout.\n- Aim: evaluate whether two common SLCO1B1 variants, 388A>G (rs2306283) and 521T>C (rs4149056), and their haplotypes are associated with (1) baseline liver function (ALT, AST), (2) baseline lipids, and (3) short-term lipid-lowering response to simvastatin.\n\nGenotyping and measurements:\n- SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C genotyped by PCR\u2013RFLP.\n- Fasting ALT, AST, TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8.\n- Minor allele frequencies: 388G = 0.28, 521C = 0.11; both SNPs in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nKey pharmacogenomic findings \u2013 hepatic function:\n1) 388A>G and baseline ALT/AST\n- 388AA homozygotes had significantly higher mean ALT and AST than 388AG/GG carriers.\n  \u2022 Dominant model (AA vs AG+GG), adjusted for age, BMI, alcohol, smoking:\n    - ALT: AA higher by ~6.1 U/L (P = 0.037).\n    - AST: AA higher by ~5.3 U/L (P = 0.002).\n- When ALT and AST were dichotomized at \u2265 40 U/L:\n  \u2022 Those in the abnormal ALT group (\u2265 40 U/L) were significantly less likely to carry the 388G allele (AG or GG): adjusted OR for AG+GG vs AA = 0.4 (95% CI 0.2\u20130.9), consistent with AA being enriched among patients with elevated ALT.\n  \u2022 Similar pattern for AST: adjusted OR for AG+GG vs AA = 0.5 (95% CI 0.2\u20131.0).\n- Interpretation: the 388A allele, particularly in AA homozygotes, is associated with higher liver enzymes, while the G allele appears protective against ALT/AST elevation in this hyperlipidemic Chinese cohort.\n\n2) 521T>C alone and baseline liver tests\n- No significant association between 521T>C genotypes and baseline ALT or AST in unadjusted or adjusted models.\n\n3) 388A>G \u00d7 521T>C interaction\n- Joint analysis (reference = carriers of 388G and 521C [GG/AG + CC/TC]):\n  \u2022 Patients with 388AA + 521TT had significantly higher ALT and AST than reference, even after adjustment:\n    - ALT: \u03b2 \u2248 +2.6 U/L (P = 0.001).\n    - AST: \u03b2 \u2248 +2.0 U/L (P = 0.001).\n- Suggests a gene\u2013gene interaction where the combination of 388AA and 521TT confers the highest liver enzyme levels.\n\n4) Haplotype analysis (388A>G\u2013521T>C) and liver enzymes\n- SNPs in strong LD (D\u2032 = 0.882).\n- Compared normal vs abnormal ALT or AST groups:\n  \u2022 The \u201chigh-enzyme\u201d groups (ALT \u2265 40 or AST \u2265 40 U/L) had:\n    - Higher frequency of 388A/521T (roughly 35\u201336% vs 26\u201327%; P \u2248 0.04 and 0.007).\n    - Lower frequency of 388G/521T (\u2248 54% vs 62%; P \u2248 0.04 and 0.032).\n  \u2022 388G/521C (haplotype *15) frequencies were similar between groups.\n- Interpretation: haplotype 388A/521T is enriched in patients with elevated ALT/AST, while haplotype 388G/521T is relatively protective.\n\nKey pharmacogenomic findings \u2013 baseline lipids:\n- 388A>G:\n  \u2022 After multivariable adjustment, 388AA carriers had modestly but significantly higher baseline HDL-C than AG/GG combined (\u03b2 \u2248 +0.14 mmol/L; P = 0.049).\n  \u2022 No significant differences for baseline TC, LDL-C, or TG by 388A>G genotype.\n- 521T>C:\n  \u2022 No significant association with baseline lipid parameters (data not shown in detail).\n\nKey pharmacogenomic findings \u2013 simvastatin response:\n- All subjects received simvastatin 20 mg/day.\n- After 4 weeks:\n  \u2022 Participants carrying the 388G allele with 521TT genotype had greater TC and LDL-C reductions than those with 388G plus 521C (TC and LDL-C reductions significantly larger; details in Supplemental Table 3).\n  \u2022 This is consistent with functional data:\n    - 388G increases OATP1B1 transport activity, fostering hepatic uptake of statin.\n    - 521C reduces OATP1B1 activity, associated with higher circulating drug but paradoxically less LDL-C lowering in some studies.\n  \u2022 Thus, the \u201chigh-activity\u201d combination (388G + 521TT) appears to confer stronger early lipid-lowering response to simvastatin.\n- After 8 weeks:\n  \u2022 No significant differences in lipid-lowering effect by either SNP or their haplotypes.\n  \u2022 Echoes other reports (pravastatin, simvastatin) where early genotype-dependent differences attenuate over longer treatment duration.\n\nSafety / CK findings:\n- CK increased overall after 4 and 8 weeks of simvastatin.\n- No significant association of 388A>G or 521T>C with CK elevations in this cohort (supplemental data), in contrast to some Western data linking 521C to myopathy.\n\nAuthors\u2019 mechanistic interpretation:\n- OATP1B1 transports bile acids and influences hepatic lipid handling.\n- 388AA\u2013521TT and haplotype 388A/521T may lead to higher bile acid levels and enhanced fatty acid absorption, potentially promoting hepatic steatosis and ALT/AST elevation.\n- 388G/521T may reduce bile acid levels, decrease hepatic fatty acid uptake, and protect against fatty liver\u2013associated aminotransferase elevation.\n- For statin efficacy, increased OATP1B1 transport (388G with intact 521T) promotes hepatic uptake of simvastatin, enhancing LDL-C lowering early in therapy.\n\nLimitations noted by authors:\n- No assessment of fatty liver status (imaging or biopsy); cannot directly link genotypes \u2192 steatosis \u2192 ALT/AST.\n- Bile acid levels were not measured; mechanistic interpretation is inferential.\n- Modest sample, particularly few 521CC homozygotes, limiting power.\n\nClinical pharmacogenomic implications:\n- In Chinese hyperlipidemic patients, SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C variants and their haplotypes are associated with:\n  \u2022 Baseline ALT/AST: 388AA and haplotype 388A/521T linked to higher enzymes; 388G/521T appears protective.\n  \u2022 Baseline HDL-C: 388AA associated with slightly higher HDL-C.\n  \u2022 Early (4-week) lipid response to simvastatin: greater TC and LDL-C reduction in 388G + 521TT carriers vs 521C carriers; effect not sustained at 8 weeks.\n- These data support a role for SLCO1B1 genotyping (beyond the well-known 521T>C myopathy risk allele) in predicting liver enzyme profile and short-term simvastatin response in East Asian populations, but replication and integration with hepatic imaging and bile acid phenotyping are needed before routine clinical implementation.\n\nTitle:\"Associations of the SLCO1B1 Polymorphisms With Hepatic Function, Baseline Lipid Levels, and Lipid-lowering Response to Simvastatin in Patients With Hyperlipidemia\"\n\nPMID: 30336686\n\nPMCID: PMC6714829",
