    "summary": "Study question and design:\n- Case\u2013control pharmacogenomic study in Iraqi rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.\n- 100 RA patients on anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 therapy (etanercept or infliximab) and 100 age/sex-matched apparently healthy controls.\n- Investigated whether NLRP3 rs4612666 (C>T) and CARD8 rs2043211 (A>T) polymorphisms influence: (1) RA susceptibility, (2) disease activity, (3) serum TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2, and (4) clinical response to TNF\u2011\u03b1 inhibitors.\n\nMethods (PGx\u2011relevant):\n- Genotyping: SYBR Green-based real\u2011time PCR allelic discrimination (tri\u2011plex) for NLRP3 rs4612666 and CARD8 rs2043211.\n- Phenotyping/clinical data: DAS\u201128, EULAR-based classification into responders vs non\u2011responders after 3 months of etanercept or infliximab.\n- Biomarkers: serum TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 (sandwich ELISA). \n\nKey baseline/clinical findings:\n- RA patients had significantly higher mean serum TNF\u2011\u03b1 (7.84 vs 6.09 pg/mL; P = 0.0005) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (2.18 vs 1.21 pg/mL; P < 0.0001) than controls.\n- DAS\u201128 correlated positively with TNF\u2011\u03b1 (r\u00b2 = 0.45) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (r\u00b2 = 0.51), both P < 0.0001.\n- 66% of patients were responders and 34% non\u2011responders after 3 months; etanercept and infliximab had comparable efficacy.\n- Non\u2011responders had much higher cytokine levels (TNF\u2011\u03b1 \u2248 13.7 vs 4.8 pg/mL; IL\u20111\u03b2 \u2248 3.36 vs 1.57 pg/mL; both P < 0.0001).\n\nGenetic associations \u2013 disease susceptibility:\n- No significant difference in genotype or allele frequencies between RA cases and controls for either SNP:\n  - CARD8 rs2043211: genotype P = 0.17; allele P = 0.059, MAF patients 0.395 vs controls 0.305.\n  - NLRP3 rs4612666: genotype P = 0.08; allele P = 0.879, similar MAF (~0.32 vs 0.31).\n- Conclusion: In this Iraqi cohort, CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 are not major susceptibility loci for RA onset.\n\nGenotype\u2013phenotype associations within RA patients:\n1) Disease activity (DAS\u201128 and EULAR category)\n- CARD8 rs2043211:\n  - TT (variant homozygote) associated with significantly higher DAS\u201128 (mean \u2248 4.65 vs 3.51 for AA; P < 0.0001).\n  - Genotype distribution differed across disease activity categories (P = 0.033); TT concentrated in moderate/high disease activity; absent in remission/low activity.\n  - Recessive T\u2011allele model (AA vs AT+TT) associated with higher disease activity (P = 0.029) and higher DAS\u201128 (P = 0.003).\n\n- NLRP3 rs4612666:\n  - TT associated with higher DAS\u201128 (\u2248 4.72 vs 3.52 for CC; P < 0.0001).\n  - Genotype distribution also differed across activity categories (P = 0.008), with TT and CT enriched in moderate/high activity.\n  - Recessive T\u2011allele model (CC vs CT+TT) associated with higher disease activity (P = 0.002) and worse DAS\u201128 (P < 0.0001).\n\n2) Response to anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 therapy\n- Clear pharmacogenomic signal for both loci.\n\n- CARD8 rs2043211:\n  - Strong difference in genotype distribution between responders and non\u2011responders (P < 0.0001).\n  - TT genotype heavily enriched among non\u2011responders; AA strongly enriched among responders.\n  - Dominant \u201cT\u2011carrier\u201d model (AA+AT vs TT) and recessive \u201cT\u2011carrier\u201d model (AA vs AT+TT) both associated with poor response; ORs indicate T\u2011allele bearing genotypes predict lower likelihood of response (e.g., for recessive model, OR ~0.18 for response when comparing AA to AT+TT).\n\n- NLRP3 rs4612666:\n  - Similarly, genotype distribution differs strongly between responders and non\u2011responders (P < 0.0001).\n  - TT and CT genotypes are over\u2011represented among non\u2011responders; CC among responders.\n  - Dominant C\u2011allele model (CC+CT vs TT) associated with better response (P < 0.0001, OR ~0.04\u20130.13 vs recessive T\u2011carrier models), while recessive T\u2011allele model (CC vs CT+TT) associates with non\u2011response.\n\n3) Cytokine levels by genotype\n- CARD8 rs2043211:\n  - TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 levels increase markedly across AA \u2192 AT \u2192 TT (P < 0.0001 for both cytokines).\n  - AA: lowest TNF\u2011\u03b1 (~5.6 pg/mL) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (~1.05 pg/mL); TT: highest TNF\u2011\u03b1 (~14.3 pg/mL) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (~4.55 pg/mL).\n  - Dominant model (AA+AT vs TT): TT associated with substantially higher TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 (P < 0.0001).\n  - Recessive model (AA vs AT+TT): T\u2011carrier genotypes associated with higher cytokines (P < 0.0001).\n\n- NLRP3 rs4612666:\n  - Similarly, CC has lowest TNF\u2011\u03b1/IL\u20111\u03b2; TT has highest levels; both P < 0.0001.\n  - Recessive T\u2011allele model (CC vs CT+TT) significantly associated with higher TNF\u2011\u03b1 (P = 0.002) and IL\u20111\u03b2 (P < 0.0001).\n  - Dominant (CC+CT vs TT) model was not significantly associated with cytokine levels (TNF\u2011\u03b1 P = 0.764, IL\u20111\u03b2 P = 0.187), suggesting a threshold (recessive-like) effect for rs4612666.\n\nPharmacogenomic interpretation:\n- Neither variant confers strong *risk* for developing RA in this Iraqi population, but both are strong *modifiers* of disease course and biological drug response.\n- Functional rationale:\n  - CARD8 encodes a negative regulator of caspase\u20111 and NF\u2011\u03baB. The rs2043211 T allele introduces a premature stop codon (p.C10X), generating truncated CARD8 with reduced inhibitory capacity, leading to enhanced NF\u2011\u03baB signaling and increased IL\u20111\u03b2 and TNF\u2011\u03b1 production.\n  - NLRP3 is a core inflammasome component. The rs4612666 T allele has been linked in other work to altered intronic enhancer activity and reduced mRNA expression, but overall, this and prior RA studies suggest that NLRP3 variation modulates inflammasome activation and IL\u20111\u03b2 production in vivo.\n- Clinical consequence:\n  - Patients with CARD8 rs2043211 TT and/or NLRP3 rs4612666 TT genotypes exhibit:\n    - Higher systemic TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 despite TNF\u2011\u03b1 blockade.\n    - Higher DAS\u201128 and predominance of moderate/high disease activity.\n    - Significantly lower probability of achieving EULAR-defined response to etanercept or infliximab after 3 months.\n- This pattern is consistent with the idea that stronger/upstream inflammasome\u2011mediated IL\u20111\u03b2/TNF\u2011\u03b1 signaling in these genotypes overwhelms standard anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 therapy, making them \u201cpoor responders.\u201d\n\nClinical and research implications:\n- These data support NLRP3/CARD8 genotyping as candidate pharmacogenomic markers for predicting short\u2011term anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 response in RA, at least in this Iraqi cohort.\n- Patients carrying CARD8 rs2043211 T allele and/or NLRP3 rs4612666 T allele may:\n  - Be at higher risk for persistent high disease activity on infliximab or etanercept.\n  - Require closer early monitoring, faster therapy escalation, or alternative biologic strategies (e.g., IL\u20116 or IL\u20111 pathway targeting, JAK inhibitors).\n- However, clinical implementation is premature:\n  - Single\u2011center, modest sample size (n=100 RA).\n  - Only two SNPs studied; no correction for multiple testing discussed.\n  - Three\u2011month outcome window; long\u2011term predictive value is unknown.\n  - Findings may be population\u2011specific (Iraqi, Middle Eastern ancestry).\n\nLimitations acknowledged by authors:\n- Small cohort and drop\u2011outs before 3 months reduce power.\n- Female predominance typical for RA but limits sex\u2011stratified genetic analysis.\n- Only two inflammasome\u2011related SNPs examined; comprehensive NLRP3/CARD8 haplotypes not assessed.\n- Results may not generalize beyond the Iraqi population due to ethnic genetic heterogeneity.\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- In Iraqi RA patients, NLRP3 rs4612666 and CARD8 rs2043211 do not significantly alter RA susceptibility, but their variant (T) genotypes are strongly associated with:\n  - Higher TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 levels\n  - More active disease (higher DAS\u201128)\n  - Poorer clinical response to infliximab and etanercept at 3 months.\n- These SNPs are promising pharmacogenomic markers of anti\u2011TNF\u2011\u03b1 response and disease severity, supporting a central role of the NLRP3\u2013CARD8 inflammasome axis in RA pathobiology and biologic treatment outcomes.\n",
