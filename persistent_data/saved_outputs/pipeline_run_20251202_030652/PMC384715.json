    "summary": "Study question and background:\nThe authors previously showed that HLA\u2011B*57:01 (HLA\u2011B*5701) strongly predicts abacavir hypersensitivity, with the signal mapping to the central MHC (the 57.1 ancestral haplotype). Here they use fine mapping and functional assays to (1) localize the causal locus within the 57.1 ancestral haplotype more precisely, and (2) explore immune mechanisms underlying abacavir hypersensitivity.\n\nDesign and population:\n- Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, 248 fully ascertained abacavir\u2011exposed patients.\n- 18 \u201cdefinite\u201d abacavir hypersensitivity cases (7.3\u20138% prevalence with strict criteria) vs 230 tolerant controls.\n- Retrospective cohort of the first 200 abacavir\u2011exposed individuals plus a prospective component (48 patients), in which individuals with known 57.1 markers were generally excluded from abacavir where possible.\n- Rigorous case definition combined: clinical features within 6 weeks of starting abacavir, clear temporal relation with drug cessation, exclusion of alternative causes, supplemented by epicutaneous abacavir patch testing and ex vivo cytokine assays.\n\nGenetic methods:\n- High\u2011resolution typing of MHC markers including HLA\u2011B*5701, C4A6, HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\u2013HLA\u2011DQ3, and dense SNP/microsatellite mapping across the central MHC between C4A6 and MEGT1.\n- Focus on recombinants of the 57.1 ancestral haplotype to pinpoint a susceptibility region.\n- Full\u2011length sequencing of the Hsp70 gene cluster (Hsp70.1, Hsp70.2, Hsp70\u2011Hom / HSPA1L) to identify haplotype\u2011specific variants.\n\nKey genetic findings:\n1. Strength of association of HLA\u2011B*5701:\n   - HLA\u2011B*5701 present in 17/18 hypersensitive vs 4/230 tolerant (94.4% vs 1.7%).\n   - OR \u2248 960, Pc < 10\u207b\u2075.\n   - In the retrospective cohort, PPV 78.9%, NPV 99.4% for abacavir hypersensitivity.\n\n2. Other 57.1 markers:\n   - C4A6: 14/18 cases vs 7/230 controls (77.8% vs 3.0%; OR \u2248 111).\n   - HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\u2013HLA\u2011DQ3: 14/18 vs 11/230 (OR \u2248 70).\n   - The full 57.1 haplotype (HLA\u2011B*5701, C4A6, HLA\u2011DRB1*07:01\u2013HLA\u2011DQ3) occurred in 14/18 cases and 0/230 controls (OR \u2248 1,485).\n\n3. Fine mapping narrows susceptibility to the Hsp70 cluster:\n   - By analyzing recombinant 57.1 haplotypes in 18 cases and 12 tolerant carriers, the minimal shared region in hypersensitive patients was narrowed to a ~14\u2011kb segment encompassing the Hsp70 gene cluster.\n   - Hsp70.1 and Hsp70.2 coding sequences were identical between hypersensitive and tolerant 57.1 carriers \u2192 excluded as susceptibility genes.\n   - Within Hsp70\u2011Hom (HSPA1L), a single nonsynonymous variant, M493T (T\u2192C, rs2227956), defined the relevant 57.1 background.\n\n4. Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T association:\n   - Hsp70\u2011Hom 493T variant present in 17/18 hypersensitive vs 51/230 tolerant (94.4% vs 22.2%; OR \u2248 59.7; Pc < 10\u207b\u2075).\n   - Alone, this variant is frequent in tolerant individuals, so it is not sufficient by itself.\n   - Crucially, the *combination* HLA\u2011B*5701 + Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T occurred in 17/18 hypersensitive vs 1/230 tolerant (94.4% vs 0.43%; OR \u2248 3,893; Pc < 10\u207b\u2075).\n   - This significantly improves discrimination relative to HLA\u2011B*5701 alone (Fisher\u2019s exact P = 0.003).\n   - Linkage disequilibrium between HLA\u2011B*5701 and Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T was strong in this cohort (relative LD = 0.82, P < 10\u207b\u2075).\n\nFunctional immunology findings:\n1. Ex vivo TNF responses to abacavir:\n   - In a 4\u2011hour PBMC assay, monocyte intracellular TNF accumulation increased markedly upon abacavir stimulation in hypersensitive patients (median 13.4\u2011fold increase, n = 8) but not in tolerant controls (median 8.9\u2011fold *decrease*, n = 9; P = 0.008).\n   - Hypersensitivity was also supported by positive epicutaneous patch tests in most clinically classified cases.\n   - Three initially suspected \u201chypersensitivity\u201d cases with alternative explanations (e.g., nevirapine) showed negative patch and TNF assays and were reclassified as tolerant.\n   - However, 2 definite hypersensitive patients had no increase in TNF in this short assay despite positive patch testing, underscoring that this functional assay is not sufficiently sensitive or specific for clinical decision\u2011making.\n\n2. CD8\u207a T\u2011cell dependence:\n   - In detailed whole\u2011blood culture experiments on two individuals who both carried HLA\u2011B*5701 + Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T:\n     - One had definite abacavir hypersensitivity; the other tolerated abacavir.\n   - Abacavir stimulation induced higher TNF secretion in the hypersensitive patient vs the tolerant carrier.\n   - Depletion of CD8\u207a T cells, but not CD4\u207a T cells, abrogated abacavir\u2011induced TNF production in the hypersensitive subject.\n   - These data strongly implicate a class I\u2013restricted, CD8\u207a T\u2011cell\u2013dependent mechanism involving monocytes as a TNF source.\n\nMechanistic interpretation:\n- The genetic mapping and LD structure support a two\u2011locus model:\n  1) HLA\u2011B*5701 provides the peptide\u2011presenting groove.\n  2) Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T modifies peptide binding/processing.\n- The M493 residue lies on the floor of the peptide\u2011binding domain of the homologous Hsc70; substituting threonine is predicted to alter substrate interaction, thus potentially changing the repertoire or stability of peptides delivered for HLA\u2011B*5701 presentation.\n- The authors hypothesize that abacavir (or a metabolite) haptenates endogenous peptides (\u201caltered self\u201d), with Hsp70\u2011Hom facilitating peptide loading onto HLA\u2011B*5701. These modified peptides could then trigger a vigorous CD8\u207a T\u2011cell response and inflammatory cytokine production (especially TNF).\n- This model is consistent with:\n  - Strong class I association (HLA\u2011B*5701),\n  - Hsp70\u2019s known role in peptide binding and cross\u2011presentation,\n  - CD8\u207a T\u2011cell dependence of TNF responses,\n  - Histological CD8\u207a infiltrates seen in abacavir patch tests in prior work.\n- The authors stress that additional, as\u2011yet unidentified factors are likely required, because they observed at least one individual carrying both HLA\u2011B*5701 and Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T who tolerated abacavir without detectable ex vivo TNF response.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics:\n- Prevalence of definite abacavir hypersensitivity in this fully ascertained cohort: ~8% (similar to other large series).\n- Prospective HLA\u2011B*5701 screening in the later part of the cohort prevented hypersensitivity among HLA\u2011B*5701\u2011negative individuals (0% incidence; 95% CI 0\u20137.5%).\n- Based on these data:\n  - Screening for HLA\u2011B*5701 alone would have reduced the prevalence of definite hypersensitivity from 8% to ~0.4% in this population.\n  - The trade\u2011off: ~1.6% of patients would be inappropriately denied abacavir (HLA\u2011B*5701 carriers who would not become hypersensitive).\n  - Adding Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T genotyping would further reduce the fraction of unnecessarily excluded patients to ~0.4%, because only the HLA\u2011B*5701 + M493T combination is highly enriched in cases relative to controls.\n  - With an 8.5% HLA\u2011B*5701 phenotype frequency, ~14 patients would need to be screened to prevent one case of hypersensitivity.\n- The study thus provides a rationale for pre\u2011prescription pharmacogenetic screening in abacavir therapy, particularly in populations of European ancestry where HLA\u2011B*5701 is common.\n\nLimitations and caveats:\n- Small number of hypersensitive cases (n=18) and rare informative recombinants limit mapping resolution; it remains possible that another functional variant tightly linked to Hsp70\u2011Hom M493T is causal.\n- Most data are from individuals of European descent; extrapolation to other ancestries requires caution given different LD structures and allele frequencies.\n- Functional assays (TNF readouts) lack sufficient sensitivity to guide clinical rechallenge decisions.\n\nOverall conclusions:\n- HLA\u2011B*5701 is a major genetic determinant of abacavir hypersensitivity.\n- Fine mapping localizes an additional susceptibility component to the Hsp70 gene cluster, specifically a haplotypic Hsp70\u2011Hom (HSPA1L) M493T variant, which in combination with HLA\u2011B*5701 confers extremely high risk (present in ~94% of definite cases and <1% of tolerant controls).\n- The pathogenesis appears to involve an HLA\u2011B*5701\u2011restricted, CD8\u207a T\u2011cell\u2013mediated immune response, potentially driven by abacavir\u2011haptenated peptides and modulated by Hsp70\u2011dependent antigen processing.\n- These findings underpin the now\u2011established practice of HLA\u2011B*5701 screening prior to abacavir and highlight the potential value of multi\u2011locus pharmacogenomic panels when haplotypic modifiers such as Hsp70\u2011Hom are important.\n",

                "We now report the results of fine recombinant genetic mapping in an expanded patient population of 248 consecutive, fully ascertained, abacavir-exposed individuals in the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, in which 18 cases of definite abacavir hypersensitivity (7.3%) and 230 tolerant controls were identified. Haplotype mapping within patients with allelic markers of the 57.1 ancestral haplotype suggests a susceptibility locus within the 14-kb Hsp70 gene cluster. HLA-B*5701 was present in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases compared with 1.7% of controls (odds ratio, 960; P < 0.00001). A haplotypic nonsynonymous polymorphism of Hsp70-Hom (HspA1L, resulting from the substitution of residue M493T in the peptide-binding subunit) was found in combination with HLA-B*5701 in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases and 0.4% of controls (odds ratio, 3,893; P < 0.00001).",
                "The only nucleotide substitution in the Hsp70-Hom gene identified in most of the abacavir-hypersensitive cases (94.4%) involvedaTtoC transition, which results in a change from methionine to threonine at amino acid residue 493 [hereafter referred to as M493T but also known as the Hsp70-Hom 2437CT allele (19) or rs2227956CT (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId=3305)]. The Hsp70-Hom M493T allele was assessed in all 248 patients of the cohort by using an allele-specific sequence-specific primer and/or the standard NcoI restriction fragment-length polymorphism assays. We observed that the Hsp70-Hom M493T allele, carried on the 57.1 AH, was detected in 94.4% of the hypersensitive group compared with 22.2% of tolerant controls (17 of 18 individuals vs. 51 of 230 individuals, OR = 59.7, Pc < 0.00001). However, in combination with HLA-B*5701, the Hsp70-Hom M493T allele was strongly associated with abacavir hypersensitivity (17 of 18 individuals vs. 1 of 230 individuals, OR = 3,893, Pc < 0.00001) (Table 2).",
                "In conclusion, we have identified the HLA-B*5701 and Hsp70-Hom M493T alleles as highly predictive genetic markers of susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity. These findings have significant implications both in terms of the clinical management of abacavir-exposed HIV-infected patients and the elucidation of basic pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this and other idiosyncratic drug hypersensitivity reactions."
