    "summary": "This study develops and externally validates a warfarin *dose\u2011refinement* algorithm specifically for Caribbean Hispanics that uniquely incorporates both pharmacogenetics and individual genomic admixture.\n\nDesign and population\n- Retrospective derivation cohort: 255 largely male (99.6%), mostly self\u2011identified Hispanic White warfarin\u2011treated outpatients from the VA Caribbean Healthcare System (San Juan, Puerto Rico), all with stable maintenance doses and in\u2011range INR.\n- External validation cohort: 55 Puerto Rican patients from Hartford Hospital (more females, somewhat younger).\n- All had blood drawn for genotyping and ancestry analysis; clinical data and warfarin dose/INR came from the electronic record.\n\nGenetics and admixture\n- Comprehensive genotyping of key warfarin pharmacogenes: CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2, NQO1, EPHX1 plus a broader physiogenomic/ancestry SNP panel.\n- High prevalence of functional variants:\n  - CYP2C9: ~30% carried at least one decreased\u2011function allele, including alleles common in Europeans (*2, *3) and African\u2011ancestry alleles (*5, *6, *8, *11). Rare promoter variants linked to *8 were also observed.\n  - VKORC1 \u22121639G>A: ~62% carriers (GA or AA).\n  - CYP4F2*3: allele frequency 0.11; ~20% carriers.\n  - NQO1*2: allele frequency 0.10; ~18% carriers.\n  - A rare VKORC1 V45A resistance variant and H7 resistance haplotypes were identified in a few subjects.\n- Ancestry proportions (European, West African, Native American) were estimated using STRUCTURE on 332 ancestry\u2011informative SNPs. Many individuals showed substantial three\u2011way admixture.\n- Native American ancestry was associated with higher frequency of low\u2011dose requirements (<3 mg/day).\n\nModel development (dose refinement after day 3\u20134)\n- Outcome: stable therapeutic warfarin maintenance dose (mg/day).\n- Predictors evaluated: demographic (age, body size, gender), clinical (indication, comorbidities, co\u2011medications, smoking, diet, day\u20111\u20133 doses, INR at day 3, target INR), genetics (CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2*3, NQO1*2, EPHX1 variants), and an admixture index (categorical: European, Native American, African, admixed).\n- Final multiple linear regression (stepwise) model included 13 predictors:\n  - Age (lower dose with older age)\n  - Initial dose (D1)\n  - Target INR (tINR)\n  - Dose\u2011adjusted INR on day 3 (INR/D3)\n  - CYP2C9*2, *3, *8 carrier status\n  - VKORC1 \u22121639 GA and AA\n  - CYP4F2*3\n  - NQO1*2\n  - Admixture index (admixed status associated with lower dose)\n  - Amiodarone co\u2011therapy\n\nKey effect directions (per variant or covariate):\n- CYP2C9 decreased\u2011function alleles (*2, *3, *8): 7\u201331% lower dose per allele (combined ~18% decrease per variant overall).\n- VKORC1 \u22121639 A allele: ~13% lower dose per A allele.\n- CYP4F2*3: ~17% higher dose per allele.\n- NQO1*2: ~10% higher dose per allele (borderline significance).\n- Admixed ancestry category: ~7% lower dose.\n- Each 0.25\u2011unit increase in INR/D3: ~11% lower final dose.\n- Age: ~5% lower dose per decade.\n\nPerformance in derivation cohort\n- Admixture\u2011adjusted pharmacogenetic refinement model:\n  - R\u00b2 = 0.70 (70% dose variance explained)\n  - MAE = 0.72 mg/day; mean absolute percentage error ~14%\n- Clinical (non\u2011genetic, no admixture) model using the same structure but excluding genotypes and admixture:\n  - R\u00b2 = 0.60\n  - MAE = 0.99 mg/day\n- Compared with published models applied to this Caribbean Hispanic cohort:\n  - Lenzini et al. refinement model R\u00b2 \u2248 0.34, MAE \u2248 1.33 mg/day.\n  - IWPC initiation algorithm R\u00b2 \u2248 0.27, MAE \u2248 1.20 mg/day.\n- By dose strata (derivation cohort):\n  - Low dose (\u22643 mg/day): pharmacogenetic model R\u00b2 63%, MAE 0.51 vs clinical model R\u00b2 50%, MAE 1.22; Lenzini and IWPC both markedly worse.\n  - Intermediate (>3\u2013<7 mg/day): pharmacogenetic R\u00b2 50%, MAE 0.61 vs clinical R\u00b2 45%, MAE 0.83.\n  - High (\u22657 mg/day): pharmacogenetic R\u00b2 20%, MAE 1.53 vs clinical R\u00b2 2%, MAE 1.53; Lenzini and IWPC performed poorly.\n\nClinical classification (derivation cohort)\n- \u201cIdeal dose\u201d defined as prediction within \u00b120% of actual stable dose (~\u00b11 mg/day around a 5 mg reference dose).\n- Among the highest\u2011risk patients (\u22643 mg/day or \u22657 mg/day), the admixture\u2011adjusted pharmacogenetic model gave ideal dosing in 54.5% vs:\n  - 29% with the clinical non\u2011genetic algorithm\n  - 34% with Lenzini\n  - 24.7% with IWPC (all p<0.001 vs pharmacogenetic model).\n- For intermediate\u2011dose patients (3\u20137 mg/day), ideal dosing:\n  - 77% for admixture\u2011adjusted pharmacogenetic vs\n  - 61% clinical\n  - 39% Lenzini\n  - 62% IWPC (p<0.001 for each comparison vs pharmacogenetic model).\n- Overall, the new model gave ideal doses in ~70% of patients, with ~11% underestimates and 19% overestimates, outperforming both prior pharmacogenetic algorithms and the clinical model.\n\nExternal validation (55 Puerto Rican patients in Hartford)\n- Admixture\u2011adjusted pharmacogenetic model:\n  - R\u00b2 \u2248 0.58\u20130.59 (the paper reports 58\u201359%)\n  - MAE = 0.89 mg/day\n  - Mean bias \u2248 24%.\n- Comparators:\n  - IWPC: R\u00b2 = 0.39, MAE = 1.60, bias 34%.\n  - Lenzini: R\u00b2 = 0.27, MAE = 1.62, bias 29%.\n  - Clinical non\u2011genetic model: R\u00b2 = 0.50, MAE = 1.34, bias 34%.\n\nInterpretation and implications\n- This is the first warfarin dosing model to explicitly incorporate an admixture measure derived from ancestry\u2011informative markers, rather than self\u2011reported race/ethnicity, in an admixed Hispanic population.\n- The inclusion of:\n  - non\u2011European CYP2C9 alleles (notably *8 and promoter variants linked to it),\n  - \u201cresistant\u201d CYP4F2*3 and NQO1*2 alleles, and\n  - individual admixture metrics\n  significantly improves dose prediction compared with: \n  - a purely clinical model, and\n  - existing pharmacogenetic models trained primarily in Europeans.\n- Admixture itself contributes a modest fraction of R\u00b2 (<1%) but corresponds to a clinically non\u2011trivial 7% dose reduction in admixed individuals and likely helps correct for population stratification that would otherwise distort genotype\u2013dose relationships.\n- INR/dose on day 3 captures much of the phenotypic warfarin sensitivity (including VKORC1 effects), but genetic factors, particularly CYP2C9, still significantly improve predictions after INR data are available, supporting ongoing value of genotyping beyond initiation.\n- The model is especially advantageous in low\u2011 and intermediate\u2011dose groups and in carriers of high\u2011risk or rare variants, where inaccurate dosing is more likely to lead to high INRs and bleeding.\n- Findings underscore the limitations of \u201cone\u2011size\u2011fits\u2011all\u201d pharmacogenetic algorithms derived in Europeans when applied to highly admixed populations and argue for ancestry\u2011aware, population\u2011specific approaches.\n\nLimitations\n- Single\u2011center derivation cohort, predominantly older male veterans.\n- Retrospective observational design; not a randomized trial of genotype\u2011guided vs standard dosing.\n- Admixture index was coded categorically rather than using continuous ancestry proportions in the final regression.\n- Genotype and admixture turnaround times (2\u20133 days) mean the algorithm is for *refinement after day ~4*, not for initial dosing.\n\nClinical outlook\n- The authors are launching a prospective, multicenter randomized trial in Caribbean Hispanics (NCT02345356) to test whether this admixture\u2011adjusted pharmacogenetic refinement algorithm improves clinical outcomes (e.g., bleeding, time in therapeutic range) versus standard care.\n- If validated, such ancestry\u2011informed pharmacogenomic dosing could reduce warfarin\u2011related adverse events and dosing disparities in Caribbean Hispanics and potentially other admixed Latino populations.\n\nIn essence, this work shows that in Caribbean Hispanics, a warfarin dose\u2011refinement algorithm that integrates CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2, NQO1, early INR response, and individual admixture provides substantially better and more clinically useful dose predictions than existing clinical or pharmacogenetic tools built in less admixed populations.",
