    "summary": "Purpose\nTo quantify how much rare DPYD variants contribute to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, and to evaluate whether next\u2011generation sequencing (NGS)\u2013based DPYD profiling could improve prediction of fluoropyrimidine toxicity beyond conventional testing for a few guideline variants.\n\nDesign and methods\n- Retrospective single\u2011center study of 2,972 adults scheduled for fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.\n- DPD phenotype was measured pre\u2011treatment using plasma uracil [U] and the dihydrouracil/uracil ratio ([UH2]/[U]) by UPLC\u2013MS/MS.\n  - Partial DPD deficiency: [UH2]/[U] \u2264 10; complete deficiency: [UH2]/[U] \u2264 1 (none observed).\n  - Alternative thresholds based on [U] alone (\u226516 \u00b5g/mL for partial deficiency, \u2265150 \u00b5g/mL for complete) were also assessed.\n- DPYD was sequenced by amplicon-based NGS (MiSeq) covering all exons and splice junctions; very rare/novel variants were Sanger-confirmed.\n- Variants were annotated with SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD; rare variants were defined as MAF <1% (very rare \u22640.1%).\n- Statistics: non-parametric tests comparing [UH2]/[U] across genotypes; enrichment analyses for variant classes in deficient vs normal phenotypes.\n\nKey cohort and phenotyping findings\n- 19.7% (580/2,972) of patients had partial DPD deficiency by [UH2]/[U] \u2264 10; no complete deficiency detected.\n- Using both [U] and [UH2]/[U] identified 21.1% (628/2,972) as DPD deficient, but concordance between the two markers at standard cut\u2011offs was low (only 114 patients overlapped):\n  - Many patients had low [UH2]/[U] but [U] <16 ng/mL, and vice versa.\n  - The data suggest currently recommended thresholds for [U] and [UH2]/[U] do not classify deficiency equivalently; [UH2]/[U] \u2264 10 labels more patients as partially deficient.\n\nGenetic findings\n- In DPD\u2011deficient group (n=580):\n  - 134 were DPYD wild-type; 446 carried \u22651 variant (208 with 1, 238 with >1), totaling 809 variants.\n  - 30 distinct variants: 7 common (MAF \u22651%), 23 rare/very rare/novel (MAF <1%); 13/23 rare variants predicted deleterious.\n  - Variant types: 77% missense, 1 nonsense, 1 indel, 2 canonical splice, 3 synonymous.\n- In phenotypically normal group (n=2,392):\n  - 623 wild-type; 1,769 with variants (831 with 1, 938 with >1), totaling 3,183 variants.\n  - 58 distinct variants: 7 common, 51 rare/very rare/novel; 18/51 rare variants predicted deleterious.\n  - Variant types: 55% missense, 2 nonsense, 2 indels, 6 canonical splice, 17 synonymous, 1 UTR.\n- All rare variants were heterozygous. Assumed predominantly European ancestry.\n\nAssociation of guideline DPYD variants with DPD activity\n- Classic high-risk variants (all heterozygous in this cohort):\n  - c.1905+1G>A (*DPYD*2A, rs3918290; splice donor).\n  - c.1679T>G (*DPYD*13, rs55886062; Ile560Ser).\n  - c.2846A>T (rs67376798; Asp949Val).\n- Each showed a strong, highly significant reduction in [UH2]/[U] compared with noncarriers, confirming their major functional impact and supporting existing CPIC/EMA guideline recommendations for genotype\u2011guided dose reduction.\n\nAssociation of common DPYD variants\nSeven common variants (MAF \u22651%) were evaluated; three showed modest but significant associations with lower [UH2]/[U]:\n- c.1236G>A (rs56038477; p.Glu412Glu; hapB3 component) \u2013 consistent with prior evidence of partial DPD deficiency.\n- c.496A>G (rs2297595; p.Met166Val).\n- c.2194G>A (rs1801160; *DPYD*6; p.Val732Ile).\nThe effect sizes on DPD activity were much smaller than for *2A, *13 and c.2846A>T, raising questions about their standalone clinical utility for dose adjustment.\n\nBurden and impact of rare/very rare DPYD variants\n- Rare variants (MAF <1%) were significantly enriched in partially DPD-deficient patients compared to those with normal activity:\n  - Any rare variant: 9.3% in deficient vs 3.2% in normal; p < 1\u00d710\u207b\u2075.\n  - After excluding *2A, *13 and c.2846A>T: 4.5% vs 2.6%; p < 0.03.\n- When restricting to rare variants predicted deleterious by CADD >15 and excluding the classic high\u2011risk alleles:\n  - 4.2% of deficient vs 1.6% of normal patients carried such variants (p < 0.001).\n- These findings indicate that:\n  - A sizable fraction of patients with low DPD activity carry rare, likely functional DPYD alleles that are not captured by standard 4\u2011variant clinical panels.\n  - Rare variants contribute measurably to interindividual variability in DPD activity and thus to fluoropyrimidine toxicity risk.\n\nInterpretation and implications for pharmacogenomics\n- Phenotyping vs genotyping:\n  - Uracil-based phenotyping ([U], [UH2]/[U]) shows substantial methodological and threshold-related variability and imperfect concordance.\n  - Genotype-based prediction of DPD activity with established high\u2011risk DPYD variants is robust and clinically validated; however, it misses many functionally impaired individuals.\n- Rare-variant contribution:\n  - Consistent with broader pharmacogenomic data showing that >90% of pharmacogene variation is rare, this study demonstrates that rare DPYD variants are significantly enriched in phenotypic DPD deficiency.\n  - Approximately one half of the rare variants detected had in silico evidence of deleteriousness (high CADD, damaging SIFT/PolyPhen), and these clustered more frequently in patients with low [UH2]/[U].\n- Clinical implication:\n  - Limiting testing to the four guideline variants (*2A, *13, c.2846A>T, hapB3) improves safety but leaves a non-trivial residual risk because additional rare loss\u2011of\u2011function or deleterious missense alleles remain undetected.\n  - Comprehensive DPYD sequencing (exons + splice sites) integrated with an interpretation framework (e.g., CADD >15 plus functional data as they accumulate) would better stratify risk and more accurately predict DPD phenotype.\n  - Such NGS-based genotyping could be combined with phenotyping to create a more sensitive and specific pre\u2011treatment screen for fluoropyrimidine dose individualization.\n\nLimitations\n- No direct toxicity data: the study links DPYD variation to a biochemical/phenotypic marker ([UH2]/[U]) but not to observed clinical fluoropyrimidine toxicity or outcomes.\n- Single-center, mostly European cohort; ancestry-specific variant spectra and effect sizes may differ in non\u2011European populations.\n- Functional effects of most rare variants were inferred from in silico tools, not from in vitro enzyme assays.\n\nAuthors\u2019 conclusions\n- Rare and very rare DPYD variants substantially contribute to interindividual variability in DPD enzyme activity.\n- Current limited DPYD genotyping panels are insufficient to identify all patients at high risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity.\n- The authors advocate incorporating NGS-based comprehensive DPYD sequencing\u2014including rare variants\u2014into routine pre\u2011emptive pharmacogenetic testing, ideally in combination with phenotyping, to optimize safety of 5\u2011FU and capecitabine without compromising efficacy.\n\nFor practice and guideline development\n- Supports ongoing movement from \u201c4-variant DPYD panels\u201d toward broader sequencing-based pharmacogenomics for fluoropyrimidines.\n- Suggests that rare-variant burden or curated variant lists (leveraging resources like PharmVar/PharmGKB) may need to be integrated into future CPIC/EMA recommendations.\n- Highlights the need for prospective, toxicity-linked studies to validate which specific rare variants (or aggregate burden scores) warrant clinical dose modification.\n",

Consistent with previous reports, the c.1236G>A (rs56038477) which is included in the risk haplotype B3 was significantly associated with low DPD activity [[30](#CR30), [31](#CR31)].
