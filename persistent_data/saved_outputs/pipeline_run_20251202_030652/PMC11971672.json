    "summary": "Design and population\n- Prospective, multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized clinical trial (PLATELET) at 37 sites in South Korea.\n- Enrolled adults with acute ischemic stroke who started clopidogrel (75\u2013300 mg) within 72 hours of symptom onset and underwent CYP2C19 genotyping.\n- Key exclusions: need for anticoagulation or non\u2013aspirin antiplatelets, recent clopidogrel use, planned coronary/cerebral revascularization within 6 months, major comorbidities, high\u2011risk cardioembolic stroke (by TOAST), or participation in other trials.\n- Final analysis: 2910 patients (mean age 65.3 years; 66.3% men).\n- CYP2C19 phenotypes (based on *1, *2, *3, *17):\n  - LOF carriers (intermediate or poor metabolizers): 1785 (61.3%)\n  - Noncarriers (extensive metabolizers): 1125 (38.7%)\n  - Intermediate: 47.8%; poor: 13.5%.\n- Baseline demographics, risk factors, stroke mechanism (TOAST), NIHSS, concomitant aspirin/statin use, and laboratory indices were well balanced between LOF carriers and noncarriers, except prior cerebral infarction was slightly more frequent in carriers (8.9% vs 6.6%).\n\nExposure and genotyping\n- All patients received clopidogrel throughout the 6\u2011month follow\u2011up; aspirin plus clopidogrel was allowed at physician discretion; other antiplatelets/anticoagulants were restricted.\n- CYP2C19 genotypes measured for *1, *2, *3, *17.\n  - Extensive metabolizers (LOF noncarriers): *1/*1, *1/*17, *17/*17.\n  - Intermediate metabolizers: one LOF allele (*1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*17, *3/*17).\n  - Poor metabolizers: two LOF alleles (*2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3).\n- Primary pharmacogenomic contrast: LOF carriers (intermediate + poor) vs noncarriers (extensive).\n\nOutcomes\n- Primary effectiveness outcome: composite 6\u2011month cardiovascular events (recurrent ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death).\n- Secondary effectiveness outcomes: individual ischemic stroke, TIA, MI, coronary revascularization, early neurologic deterioration (END \u22647 days), and functional outcome at 3 months (mRS 0\u20132).\n- Safety outcomes: major bleeding (intracranial, fatal, ocular, bleeding requiring \u22652 units transfusion or hospitalization) and all\u2011cause mortality over 6 months.\n- Analyses: intention\u2011to\u2011treat, Kaplan\u2013Meier with log\u2011rank, Cox models with multivariable adjustment; sensitivity analysis with propensity\u2011weighted matching; preplanned subgroups (sex, hypertension, diabetes, NIHSS, TOAST, smoking, etc.).\n\nKey results\n1. Primary composite cardiovascular outcome\n- Events at 6 months:\n  - LOF carriers: 49/1785 (2.7%)\n  - Noncarriers: 18/1125 (1.6%)\n- Noncarriers had a significantly lower risk:\n  - HR for noncarriers vs carriers: 0.58 (95% CI, 0.34\u20130.99); log\u2011rank P = 0.048.\n- In multivariable Cox analysis (adjusted for age, sex, vascular risk factors, TOAST, eGFR, PRU, NIHSS, aspirin use, prior vascular disease), LOF noncarrier status remained protective:\n  - Adjusted HR 0.58 (95% CI, 0.33\u20130.99; P = 0.049).\n\n2. Recurrent stroke\n- Recurrent stroke at 6 months:\n  - LOF carriers: 45/1785 (2.5%)\n  - Noncarriers: 16/1125 (1.4%)\n- Noncarriers again had a lower risk:\n  - HR for noncarriers vs carriers: 0.56 (95% CI, 0.32\u20131.00); P = 0.047.\n- Ischemic stroke alone showed a similar numeric pattern (2.4% vs 1.4%; P = 0.06) but did not reach conventional significance.\n\n3. Other effectiveness outcomes\n- MI: rare and similar (0.1% vs 0.2%; P = 0.64).\n- Cardiovascular death: 2 events in carriers vs 0 in noncarriers (not statistically different).\n- TIA, coronary revascularization, END, and 3\u2011month functional outcome (mRS 0\u20132 ~82% in both groups) were not significantly different.\n\n4. Safety outcomes\n- Major bleeding:\n  - LOF carriers: 11/1785 (0.6%)\n  - Noncarriers: 9/1125 (0.8%)\n  - HR 1.29 (95% CI, 0.53\u20133.13); P = 0.56.\n- All\u2011cause mortality:\n  - LOF carriers: 5/1785 (0.3%)\n  - Noncarriers: 1/1125 (0.1%)\n  - HR 0.31 (95% CI, 0.04\u20132.71); P = 0.27.\n- Thus, genotype\u2011dependent differences in cardiovascular efficacy were not accompanied by differences in bleeding or mortality.\n\n5. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses\n- Subgroups: no meaningful heterogeneity by age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, NIHSS, or TOAST, except for smoking:\n  - Among smokers, the primary outcome was significantly less frequent in noncarriers vs carriers (HR 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01\u20130.64; P = 0.02; Pinteraction = 0.03), suggesting a particularly strong genotype effect in smokers.\n- Intermediate vs poor metabolizers (within LOF carriers): no significant difference in primary outcome or in patients on dual therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel). No primary events occurred among those on clopidogrel monotherapy, precluding comparison.\n- Propensity\u2011weighted analyses produced results consistent with the primary findings, supporting robustness to measured confounding.\n\n6. Multivariable predictors\n- In adjusted models:\n  - CYP2C19 LOF noncarrier status: protective (HR 0.58).\n  - TOAST small\u2011vessel occlusion: protective vs other mechanisms (HR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19\u20130.71; P = 0.003).\n  - NIHSS 3\u20135 category also appeared associated with fewer composite events vs NIHSS \u22641; higher NIHSS >5 did not significantly differ from very low NIHSS, suggesting a non\u2011linear relationship, potentially driven by low overall event rates.\n- Traditional vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking), renal function, and prior vascular history were not independently associated with the composite outcome in this relatively short (6\u2011month), low\u2011event setting.\n\nPharmacogenomic interpretation\n- Clopidogrel is a prodrug requiring bioactivation via CYP2C19. LOF alleles (*2, *3) reduce active metabolite formation, leading to high on\u2011treatment platelet reactivity and reduced antiplatelet efficacy.\n- This trial directly links CYP2C19 LOF carrier status to a higher incidence of clinically important vascular events in a real\u2011world acute ischemic stroke cohort treated uniformly with clopidogrel.\n- The genotype effect appears driven mainly by recurrent stroke rather than MI or cardiovascular death, which were rare.\n- The absence of a bleeding signal suggests that the genotype effect is selective for efficacy (insufficient platelet inhibition) rather than safety.\n- Findings align with prior Asian data (e.g., CHANCE and CHANCE\u20112) and meta\u2011analyses showing worse outcomes with clopidogrel in CYP2C19 LOF carriers, especially in populations where LOF allele frequency is high (~60% in Asians).\n- Intermediate and poor metabolizers did not significantly differ from each other, implying that even a single LOF allele (intermediate metabolizer status) may be sufficient to meaningfully blunt clopidogrel effect in this clinical context.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics\n- Among Korean (and more broadly, East Asian) patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel, CYP2C19 LOF carriers are at higher risk of composite cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke over 6 months, with no offsetting reduction in bleeding.\n- These data support the concept of genotype\u2011guided antiplatelet selection:\n  - For LOF carriers, alternative P2Y12 inhibitors such as ticagrelor (whose efficacy is genotype\u2011independent) may be preferable, as supported by CHANCE\u20112.\n  - For noncarriers (extensive metabolizers), clopidogrel remains an effective and safe option.\n- Because ~60% of Asians are LOF carriers, the clinical yield of CYP2C19 testing is particularly high in this population. The study reinforces existing CPIC guidance and growing expert consensus recommending consideration of CYP2C19 genotyping when choosing clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention in populations with high LOF prevalence.\n- The notable interaction with smoking raises the possibility that smokers who are noncarriers may derive particular benefit from clopidogrel, but this finding is exploratory and should not alter practice without confirmation.\n\nLimitations relevant to interpretation\n- Nonrandomized, open\u2011label design: although clopidogrel use was universal and outcomes were adjudicated blinded to genotype, residual confounding by unmeasured factors cannot be excluded.\n- Follow\u2011up limited to 6 months; long\u2011term genotype effects beyond this window remain uncertain.\n- Conducted exclusively in South Korea; generalizability to non\u2011Asian populations (where LOF frequencies are lower and risk profiles differ) is limited.\n- No information on precise timing of clopidogrel initiation within the 72\u2011hour window or loading dose; potential early differences cannot be explored.\n- Only CYP2C19 *1, *2, *3, *17 were assessed; other genes (e.g., ABCB1, CES1, PON1) and non\u2011CYP2C19 pathways influencing clopidogrel response were not evaluated.\n- Overall event rates were low, leading to relatively wide CIs and limited power for some subgroup and secondary analyses.\n\nBottom line\n- In a large, prospective Korean cohort with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel, CYP2C19 loss\u2011of\u2011function alleles were associated with a significantly higher 6\u2011month risk of composite cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke, without increased bleeding or mortality.\n- These results strengthen the evidence base for CYP2C19 genotype\u2013guided antiplatelet therapy in acute ischemic stroke, particularly in Asian populations, and support considering non\u2013CYP2C19\u2013dependent agents (e.g., ticagrelor) for LOF carriers.\n\nTitle\nCytochrome P450 2C19 Genotypes and Clopidogrel in Patients With Ischemic Stroke: A Nonrandomized Clinical Trial\n\nPMID\n40184070\n\nPMCID\nPMC11971672",
