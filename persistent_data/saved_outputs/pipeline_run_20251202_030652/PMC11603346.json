    "summary": "Objective:\nTo systematically review pharmacogenetic variants associated with antiretroviral drug\u2013induced liver injury (ARVDILI) from non\u2011nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and to quantify the association between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and efavirenz (EFV)\u2011 or nevirapine (NVP)\u2011induced liver injury in people living with HIV (PLHIV).\n\nMethods:\n- Databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science (to Oct 10, 2024), PROSPERO-registered (CRD42024593948).\n- Step 1 (systematic review): Identified original human studies evaluating genetic polymorphisms and ARVDILI with antiretrovirals. Genes were compiled and protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) networks analyzed using STRING/KEGG to prioritize candidates.\n- Step 2 (meta-analysis): Focused on CYP2B6, given high report frequency and network centrality.\n  - Inclusion: HIV-infected adults on EFV or NVP; assessment of CYP2B6 variants and ARVDILI risk; case\u2013control or cohort design; liver injury defined using CIOMS/RUCAM or explicit biochemical criteria; no major hepatic comorbidities or strong confounders.\n  - Quality: Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale; only studies scoring >6 included.\n  - Statistics: Mantel\u2013Haenszel fixed-effects model; odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs; heterogeneity by I\u00b2 and \u03c7\u00b2; funnel plots for publication bias; sensitivity analysis by leave\u2011one\u2011out.\n\nSystematic review findings (all ARVs):\n- 50 articles were included in the overall pharmacogenomic survey; 39 reported gene\u2013ARVDILI associations.\n- Most frequently studied genes for ARVDILI:\n  - UGT1A1 (11 reports)\n  - CYP2B6 (11 reports)\n  - ABCB1 (4 reports)\n  - HLA-Cw (mainly HLA-Cw*04) (2 reports)\n  - HLA-DRB1 (2 reports)\n- PPI/KEGG network analysis:\n  - The collected ARVDILI-associated proteins were significantly enriched in xenobiotic/drug metabolism pathways.\n  - CYP2B6, CYP1A1 and CYP2D6 emerged as central hubs, suggesting that phase I biotransformation pathways are critical in ARVDILI pathogenesis.\n  - CYP2B6 was chosen as the primary candidate for quantitative synthesis.\n\nMeta-analysis: CYP2B6 and EFV-induced liver injury\n\nStudy set:\n- 3 studies (2 cohorts, 1 case\u2013control), all in African populations (Tanzania, Ethiopia).\n- Total: 795 PLHIV on EFV\n  - 106 ARVDILI cases\n  - 689 non-ARVDILI controls\n- DILI defined by CIOMS criteria; controls drawn from hospital-based HIV cohorts.\n- Main variant: CYP2B6*6 haplotype, characterized by rs3745274 (516G>T, Q172H) and rs2279343 (785A>G, K262R), associated with reduced enzyme expression (\u224850\u201375% lower) but preserved catalytic site.\n\nResults (EFV):\n- Compared to CYP2B6*1/*1 (normal metabolizers), carriers of CYP2B6*6 had significantly higher risk of EFV-induced liver injury:\n  - Heterozygotes (*1/*6): OR 1.83 (95% CI 1.15\u20132.90), P = 0.01; I\u00b2 = 0%\n  - Homozygotes (*6/*6): OR 2.48 (95% CI 1.28\u20134.79), P = 0.007; I\u00b2 = 0%\n  - Any *6 ( *1/*6 + *6/*6 vs *1/*1 ): OR 1.94 (95% CI 1.24\u20133.01), P = 0.003; I\u00b2 = 0%\n- Sensitivity analyses: Excluding any single study did not materially alter the pooled estimates.\n- Funnel plots: Symmetric; no substantial publication bias detected.\n\nInterpretation (EFV):\n- CYP2B6*6 (poor/slow metabolizer phenotype) increases susceptibility to EFV-related hepatotoxicity.\n- Mechanistic rationale:\n  - CYP2B6 is the major catalyst of EFV primary and secondary metabolism.\n  - Reduced CYP2B6 activity leads to higher EFV exposure.\n  - EFV and its primary metabolite 8\u2011hydroxy\u2011EFV (8\u2011OH\u2011EFV) are both hepatotoxic: they impair mitochondrial membrane potential, reduce O\u2082 consumption, increase ROS, and trigger apoptosis in hepatocytes.\n  - Accumulation of EFV and 8\u2011OH\u2011EFV likely underlies the higher DILI risk in CYP2B6*6 carriers.\n\nMeta-analysis: CYP2B6 and NVP-induced liver injury\n\nStudy set:\n- 2 case\u2013control studies: Malawi/Uganda (African) and Italy (Caucasian).\n- Total: 820 PLHIV on NVP\n  - 38 ARVDILI cases\n  - 782 non-ARVDILI controls\n- DILI definitions: RUCAM or ALT > 40 IU/L with jaundice; hospital-based controls.\n\nResults (NVP):\n- Compared with CYP2B6*1/*1 (normal metabolizers):\n  - Heterozygotes (*1/*6): OR 0.44 (95% CI 0.22\u20130.91), P = 0.03; I\u00b2 = 0%\n  - Homozygotes (*6/*6): OR 0.45 (95% CI 0.15\u20131.32), P = 0.14; I\u00b2 = 0% (not statistically significant, wide CI)\n  - Any *6 ( *1/*6 + *6/*6 vs *1/*1 ): OR 0.42 (95% CI 0.21\u20130.84), P = 0.01; I\u00b2 = 0%\n- Sensitivity analyses: The protective association for *1/*6 and *1/*6 + *6/*6 persisted when studies were removed one by one.\n- Funnel plots: No major asymmetry; no strong publication bias signal.\n\nInterpretation (NVP):\n- In contrast to EFV, CYP2B6*6 was associated with a *lower* risk of NVP-induced liver injury (especially in heterozygotes).\n- Possible mechanisms and explanations:\n  - NVP is metabolized by multiple P450s (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, etc.) to several hydroxylated species (2-, 3-, 8-, 12\u2011OH\u2011NVP) and a carboxy metabolite.\n  - 12\u2011OH\u2011NVP, primarily a CYP3A4 product, has been more strongly linked to hepatotoxicity and skin rash than 8\u2011OH\u2011NVP, the CYP2B6\u2011related metabolite.\n  - Reduced CYP2B6 activity might shift the metabolic balance toward pathways that yield less hepatotoxic intermediates, or reduce formation of specific reactive metabolites.\n  - However, previous experimental and clinical data (e.g., LiverTox, Ciccacci et al.) suggest that CYP2B6 induction/bioactivation can generate toxic NVP intermediates, supporting a role for CYP2B6 in toxicity as well.\n  - The net effect may depend heavily on combined CYP2B6\u2013CYP3A4\u2013CYP2D6 genotypes and other host/environmental factors.\n- Authors emphasize that the NVP findings are based on few studies and small case numbers; conclusions are therefore tentative.\n\nClinical pharmacogenomic implications:\n- EFV:\n  - CYP2B6*6 is a consistent risk factor for EFV-induced hepatotoxicity in African cohorts.\n  - This parallels known CYP2B6\u2013EFV PK relationships (slow metabolizers have higher EFV levels and more CNS toxicity; here also higher DILI risk).\n  - In settings where EFV is still used, pre-emptive CYP2B6 genotyping could support avoiding EFV or using alternative regimens in *6 carriers, especially homozygotes, and could justify closer liver function monitoring.\n\n- NVP:\n  - CYP2B6*6 appears protective against clinically defined NVP DILI in the limited data available.\n  - If validated, genotyping might not be used to *exclude* NVP in *6 carriers; however, due to small sample sizes and conflicting mechanistic data, routine decision-making based solely on CYP2B6 for NVP cannot currently be recommended.\n  - Additional genes (e.g., CYP3A4/5, HLA alleles, other metabolizing/transport genes) need to be integrated into multi-gene risk models.\n\n- Across NNRTIs and ARVs generally:\n  - UGT1A1, CYP2B6, ABCB1, and selected HLA alleles are repeatedly implicated in ARVDILI.\n  - Network analyses emphasize that ARVDILI is a multi-gene xenobiotic metabolism phenomenon rather than a single-gene effect; polygenic and pathway-based approaches are warranted.\n\nStrengths:\n- First dedicated systematic review and meta-analysis specifically focusing on CYP2B6 and NNRTI-induced liver injury in PLHIV.\n- Rigorous selection and quality assessment, excluding studies with significant confounding or weak methodology.\n- Use of PPI/KEGG analysis to prioritize pharmacogenes within a broader ARVDILI gene set.\n- Consistent direction and magnitude of effect estimates for EFV across all included African studies, with no heterogeneity.\n\nLimitations:\n- Language restriction to English introduces potential selection bias.\n- Number of included studies and ARVDILI cases is small, particularly for NVP (only 38 cases, 2 studies), limiting power and precision.\n- All EFV studies were in African populations; NVP studies in African and one Italian cohort. Results may not generalize to populations with different CYP2B6 allele frequencies or different background comorbidities.\n- DILI definitions varied across studies (CIOMS vs RUCAM; some older vs newer criteria); these differences can influence case classification.\n- Only CYP2B6 was meta-analyzed; other important genes (e.g., UGT1A1, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB1, CYP3A4/5) were not quantitatively synthesized.\n- PPI-based prioritization does not itself prove causal relevance; it simply suggests network centrality.\n\nAuthors\u2019 conclusions:\n- Among genes evaluated for ARVDILI, UGT1A1, CYP2B6 and ABCB1 are most frequently studied; PPI data point to CYP2B6 as a central node in xenobiotic metabolism.\n- CYP2B6*6 significantly increases the risk of EFV-induced liver injury in PLHIV, while CYP2B6*1/*6 (and *1/*6 + *6/*6) are associated with a significantly lower risk of NVP-induced liver injury.\n- These findings support CYP2B6 genotyping as a candidate tool for NNRTI selection and monitoring strategies in PLHIV, especially for EFV.\n- Larger, ethnically diverse, well-phenotyped studies incorporating multiple pharmacogenes and standardized DILI criteria are needed before robust clinical decision algorithms can be finalized.\n\nFor practical PGx use:\n- EFV: CYP2B6*6 carriers (especially *6/*6) should be considered at elevated risk of hepatotoxicity and may benefit from EFV dose reduction, alternative regimens, or enhanced LFT monitoring, consistent with current EFV PGx literature.\n- NVP: Do not yet rely on CYP2B6 alone for decision-making; consider it exploratory until replicated in larger, multi-ethnic cohorts and integrated with CYP3A4/5 and HLA markers.\n\nOverall, the paper consolidates current evidence that CYP2B6 genotype is an important determinant of NNRTI-related liver injury risk, underscores drug-specific and pathway-specific differences between EFV and NVP, and provides a framework for subsequent pharmacogenomic implementation studies in HIV treatment.\n",
