For HLA-DRB1*01:01, 605 peptides were eluted in untreated cells and 359 from nevirapine treated cells; comparison of core 9-mers showed very similar distributions for anchoring amino acids at P1 and P9, and small apparent differences at P4 and P6 did not reach statistical significance after multiple-comparison adjustment. All peptides from the nevirapine-treated sample (>12 mer) were tested for binding to HLA-DRB1*01:01 in the presence and absence of nevirapine, and no difference in binding was observed. Molecular modelling and docking predicted weak binding scores (~\u22126.1 kcal/mol) and suggested that nevirapine is unlikely to bind directly to HLA-DRB1*01:01 in the presence of peptide.",

Apparent small differences in the frequency of some amino acids at P4 and P6 did not reach statistical significance with adjustment for multiple comparisons.

    "summary": "Objective:\nTo explain why multiple HLA class I and II alleles are associated with cutaneous nevirapine (NVP) hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) and to identify the structural features of HLA peptide\u2011binding grooves that drive risk or protection across ancestries.\n\nDesign and methods:\n- Case\u2013control study of 151 HIV\u20111\u2013infected patients with severe cutaneous NVP HSR (grade 3/4 rash) and 413 NVP\u2011tolerant controls from African, Asian, European and Hispanic populations.\n- High\u2011resolution (4\u2011digit) HLA typing at HLA-A, -B, -C and HLA-DRB1.\n- Statistical analyses included ethnicity\u2011adjusted and ancestry\u2011stratified logistic regression.\n- Rather than testing each allele independently, alleles were grouped by:\n  - Known HLA supertypes.\n  - Structural motifs of the peptide\u2011binding pockets (class I: pockets A\u2013F; class II: P1, P4, P6, P7, P9).\n  - Functional clustering of peptide\u2011binding specificity using MHCcluster.\n- Molecular docking using crystal structures of HLA-C*04:01, HLA-B*15:01, and HLA-DRB1*01:01 to explore likely NVP binding sites.\n- For HLA-DRB1*01:01, extensive peptide elution (LC\u2011MS/MS) and binding assays \u00b1 NVP were used to see if NVP alters the peptide repertoire or binding affinity.\n- Multivariable models incorporated both HLA clusters and CYP2B6 slow\u2011metabolizer genotypes, previously shown to raise NVP exposure.\n\nKey results:\n\n1. Primary HLA-C risk cluster: shared F pocket\n- At the single\u2011allele level, HLA-C*04:01 is the only consistent, significant risk allele across all ancestries for severe cutaneous NVP HSR (overall OR \u22483.1; ethnicity\u2011adjusted p \u224810\u207b\u2074; similar ORs in Asians, Caucasians and Africans).\n- Additional ancestry\u2011specific HLA-C risk alleles were identified:\n  - HLA-C*05:01 in Caucasians (OR \u22482.7\u20132.8).\n  - HLA-C*18:01 in Africans (increased OR; borderline significance due to small N).\n- When HLA-C alleles were grouped by peptide\u2011binding pocket sequences, the strongest association was a cluster defined by a specific F pocket motif shared by:\n  - HLA-C*04:01, *04:03, *04:06, *04:07\n  - HLA-C*05:01, *05:09\n  - HLA-C*18:01\n  These alleles share a conserved F pocket sequence (Asp74\u2013Asn77\u2013Lys80\u2013Leu81\u2013Tyr84\u2013Leu95\u2013Arg97\u2013Asn114\u2013Phe116\u2013Tyr123\u2013Trp133\u2013Thr143\u2013Lys146\u2013Trp147).\n- In multivariable models adjusted for ethnicity and metabolism:\n  - HLA-C*04:01 carriage: OR 4.1 (95% CI 2.4\u20136.9).\n  - Other risk F\u2011pocket HLA\u2011C alleles: OR 2.9 (1.6\u20135.2).\n- The effect could not be explained simply by higher HLA-C surface expression; when the HLA-C F\u2011pocket risk cluster was included, imputed expression level lost significance.\n\nMechanistic inference for HLA-C:\n- Docking of NVP into the HLA-C*04:01 crystal structure indicated preferred binding in either the B pocket (near position 99) or the F pocket; the F pocket signal is consistent with the strongest statistical association.\n- A key shared residue among risk HLA-C alleles is Arg156, which in the HLA-C*04:01\u2013peptide structure stabilizes the central peptide region (P3) and can act as an alternative N\u2011terminal anchor.\n- Proposed model: in risk HLA-C alleles, NVP docks within or near the F pocket, co\u2011occupying the C\u2011terminal anchoring site with the peptide; Arg156 helps stabilize the peptide in the presence of NVP. This could generate or stabilize a disease\u2011causing HLA\u2013peptide\u2013drug complex recognized by pathogenic T cells.\n\n2. Protective HLA-B cluster: shared B pocket (B62 supertype subgroup)\n- Across HLA-B, the most prominent secondary effect was protection mediated by a specific B\u2011pocket motif, independent of HLA-C risk.\n- A characteristic B\u2011pocket sequence (Tyr7\u2013Tyr9\u2013Ala24\u2013Val34\u2013Met/Thr45\u2013Glu63\u2013Ile66\u2013Ser67\u2013Asn70\u2013Tyr/Phe99) defined a protective cluster of B62 supertype alleles:\n  - HLA-B*15:01, *15:12, *15:24, *15:25, *15:27, *15:32, *15:35\n  - HLA-B*52:01\n- Carriage of this protective B62 cluster: OR ~0.18\u20130.2 (highly significant), indicating ~80% reduction in risk.\n- Other B62 alleles that differ at key B\u2011pocket residues (e.g., HLA-B*15:02, *46:01) did not confer protection.\n\nMechanistic inference for HLA-B protection:\n- Structural data for HLA-B*15:01 (B62 supertype) show a hydrophobic B pocket.\n- Docking predicts that NVP binds within this conserved hydrophobic B pocket across protective HLA-B62 alleles.\n- Possible interpretation: in individuals carrying such HLA-B alleles, NVP\u2013peptide complexes presented by HLA-B may mimic tolerated self complexes or compete with presentation by risk HLA-C molecules, functionally diverting or dampening pathogenic T\u2011cell responses.\n\n3. Secondary HLA-B risk alleles: distinct E/F pockets\n- The strongest HLA-B risk allele at the pocket level is HLA-B*35:05, defined by a unique E pocket (Ser97\u2013Asp114\u2013Trp147\u2013Val152\u2013Leu156).\n- Other B*35 alleles lack Ser97; the overall B*35 family was *not* significantly predisposing when analyzed as a group.\n- In Southeast Asians, 9/10 NVP HSR cases carrying B*35:05 also carry HLA-C*04:01, pointing to a strong haplotypic and possibly synergistic effect.\n- Additional risk clusters after adjusting for the HLA-C risk group included:\n  - HLA-B*51, B*54, B*55, B*56, B*67, B*78 (B07 supertype group) \u2013 multivariable OR \u22482.3.\n  - HLA-B*38, B*39 (B27 supertype) \u2013 multivariable OR \u22481.8.\n- These risk alleles share specific E/F pocket motifs (e.g. Leu95\u2013Arg97\u2013Asn114\u2013Phe/Lys116\u2013Val152\u2013Leu156 or Trp95\u2013Thr97\u2013Asn114\u2013Phe/Leu/Tyr116\u2013Val/Glu152\u2013Leu156), supporting the idea that particular E/F pocket chemistries predispose to NVP HSR.\n\n4. HLA-DRB1 risk cluster: shared P4 pocket\n- A secondary risk cluster at HLA-DRB1 was identified, composed of DR1 and DR4 supertypes:\n  - HLA-DRB1*01:01, *01:02, *01:03\n  - HLA-DRB1*04:04, *04:05, *04:08, *04:10\n- This cluster showed an overall OR ~2.0 (95% CI 1.23\u20133.24) in multivariable analysis.\n- These DRB1 risk alleles share a P4 pocket motif at \u03b2\u2011chain positions 13, 70, 71, 74 and 78: (Phe/His)13\u2013Gln70\u2013Arg71\u2013Ala74\u2013Tyr78.\n- By contrast, HLA-DRB1*04:01 and *04:15 (common in Caucasians) differ only at \u03b271 (Lys instead of Arg) and appear protective (significantly enriched in controls vs cases), implicating \u03b271 as a key determinant.\n\nMechanistic inference for HLA-DRB1:\n- \u03b271 in the P4 pocket of DRB1 is known to influence both peptide specificity and the orientation of bound peptides, thereby altering TCR recognition in autoimmune diseases.\n- In this study:\n  - Peptide elution from HLA-DRB1*01:01 single\u2011antigen cell lines \u00b1 NVP showed no major shift in repertoire: similar peptide lengths and similar anchor usage at P1 and P9; small apparent differences at P4/P6 were not statistically significant.\n  - In vitro binding assays \u00b1 NVP revealed no effect of NVP on peptide binding affinity to HLA-DRB1*01:01.\n  - Docking predicted only weak NVP interaction (\u20136.1 kcal/mol) with HLA-DRB1*01:01 in the presence of peptide, making direct binding within the DR groove unlikely.\n- Thus, for class II, the data do *not* support an abacavir\u2011like mechanism of drug-induced peptide repertoire change. The authors suggest more indirect possibilities: tissue\u2011restricted peptide changes, drug effects at the TCR interface, or interactions with peptide\u2013HLA complexes not captured in the in vitro system.\n\n5. Integration with CYP2B6 and ancestry\n- CYP2B6 slow-metabolizer genotypes remained an independent risk factor (overall OR \u22482.1), consistent with higher NVP exposure contributing to HSR risk.\n- When HLA-C risk cluster, HLA-B risk/protective clusters, HLA-DRB1 risk cluster, and CYP2B6 were all included, effect sizes were comparable across African, Asian, and Caucasian groups despite very different allele frequencies.\n- No strong evidence for a single dominant chromosome 6p haplotype beyond the B*35:05\u2013C*04:01 haplotype in SE Asians; rather, structurally similar pockets across different alleles and backgrounds explain multi\u2011ethnic risk.\n\nConceptual advance:\n- Instead of treating each HLA allele independently, the study demonstrates that *structurally and functionally defined pockets* in the peptide\u2011binding groove (particularly the class I F and B pockets and class II P4 pocket) better explain the complex pattern of NVP HSR associations across ancestries.\n- The primary predisposition is attributable to a shared HLA-C F pocket architecture (plus Arg156), which likely accommodates NVP together with specific peptides and drives pathogenic CD8\u207a T\u2011cell responses.\n- Secondary modulation occurs via:\n  - Protective HLA-B B62 alleles with a shared hydrophobic B pocket, apparently binding NVP in a way that reduces risk.\n  - Additional HLA-B alleles with specific E/F pocket motifs that increase risk.\n  - HLA-DRB1 alleles with a shared P4 pocket signature that influence CD4\u207a T\u2011cell help, probably via peptide orientation and TCR recognition rather than direct drug binding.\n\nImplications for pharmacogenomics and clinical translation:\n- There is no single, high\u2013negative\u2011predictive\u2011value HLA allele for NVP analogous to HLA-B*57:01 for abacavir. Instead, risk is distributed over multiple structurally related alleles.\n- A pocket\u2011based framework provides a mechanistic explanation for multi\u2011allelic, multi\u2011ethnic associations and may allow prediction of risk for rare or untested alleles that share critical binding\u2011groove residues with known risk alleles.\n- The same analytical approach (grouping alleles by binding pocket chemistry and peptide\u2011binding specificity) is likely applicable to other drug HSR syndromes and autoimmune diseases where multiple HLA alleles are implicated.\n- Clinically, comprehensive screening across all risk alleles is not yet practical in most regions, and positive predictive values remain modest (many carriers will tolerate NVP). However, these data identify particularly high\u2011risk constellations (e.g. HLA-C*04:01 or F\u2011pocket cluster without protective B62 alleles; HLA-C*04:01 plus B*35:05 in Asians; co\u2011carriage of DRB1 P4\u2011risk alleles) and confirm a role for CYP2B6 slow metabolism.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nSevere cutaneous NVP hypersensitivity is primarily driven by HLA-C alleles that share a specific F\u2011pocket structure (exemplified by HLA-C*04:01), with additional modulation by protective HLA-B62 B\u2011pocket alleles, other HLA-B E/F\u2011pocket risk alleles, HLA-DRB1 P4\u2011pocket alleles, and CYP2B6\u2011mediated drug exposure. Drug\u2013peptide\u2013HLA interactions are thus governed by shared pocket chemistry rather than isolated alleles, explaining the multiplicity and ancestry\u2011spanning nature of HLA associations with NVP HSR and offering a generalizable framework for dissecting complex HLA\u2011drug interactions.\n",
