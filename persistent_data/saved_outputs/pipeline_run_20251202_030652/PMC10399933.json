    "summary": "Objective\nTo evaluate how common pharmacokinetic variants in SLCO1B1, ABCG2 and CYP2C9 affect real\u2011world statin intolerance, using nationwide prescription and laboratory data linked to biobank genotypes, and to test whether a register\u2011based \u201cstatin switch\u201d phenotype is a useful proxy for intolerance.\n\nStudy design and population\n- Register-based cohort from Helsinki Biobank linked to Finnish national prescription and clinical chemistry registries.\n- 2,042 incident statin users with consent and DNA (out of 2,242 identified; exclusions mainly for missing genotypes, combination products, and a reimbursement-policy\u2013driven switching period).\n- Index statins: simvastatin (n=916), atorvastatin (n=780), rosuvastatin (n=184), fluvastatin (n=70), pravastatin (n=92).\n\nGenetics\n- SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (c.521T>C; Val174Ala).\n- ABCG2 rs2231142 (c.421C>A; Gln141Lys).\n- CYP2C9 rs1799853 (*2), rs1057910 (*3); used to classify CYP2C9 normal, intermediate, poor metabolizers.\n- Genotype frequencies in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium and similar to Finnish reference data.\n\nPhenotyping of statin intolerance\nTwo operational phenotypes, defined per index statin:\n1) Primary: \u201cstatin switch\u201d \u2013 change from index statin to a different statin (ATC code change; brand changes ignored). Event date = last purchase of index statin.\n2) Secondary: \u201cstatin switch + CK\u201d \u2013 statin switch plus any creatine kinase (CK) measurement from 30 days before to 90 days after the switch (value not required to be elevated), intended to enrich for suspected myopathy.\n- Follow-up from first index statin purchase until 365 days without any statin purchase, death, or 31 Dec 2016.\n- Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for daily statin dose (categorical). Genotypes modeled additively; dose categories merged if <10 individuals.\n\nKey results by statin\n\nSimvastatin (n=916; median follow-up 532 days)\n- Intolerance events: 232 statin switchers; 22 switchers with qualifying CK measurement.\n- SLCO1B1 c.521C/C vs T/T:\n  - Statin switch: HR 1.88 (95% CI 1.08\u20133.25; P=0.025).\n  - Statin switch + CK: HR 5.44 (95% CI 1.49\u201319.9; P=0.011).\n- Simvastatin dose \u226540 mg vs 10 mg increased switch risk: HR 1.48 (95% CI 1.03\u20132.12; P=0.035).\n- Heterozygotes (T/C) showed no clear increase with the primary switch phenotype.\n- This robustly replicates the established association of SLCO1B1*5 (521C) with simvastatin intolerance in real-world data and validates the switch-based phenotype.\n\nAtorvastatin (n=780; median follow-up 556.5 days)\n- Intolerance events: 128 switchers; 18 switchers + CK.\n- No statistically significant associations for:\n  - SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (including C/C) with either phenotype.\n  - ABCG2 c.421C>A.\n  - Combined \u201crisk allele count\u201d (SLCO1B1 + ABCG2).\n  - Atorvastatin dose.\n- Point estimates for SLCO1B1 C\u2011allele carriers in the switch + CK phenotype were in the same direction and magnitude as prior reports, but underpowered to reach significance, likely because most patients were on low\u2013moderate doses (10\u201320 mg, few at 80 mg).\n\nRosuvastatin (n=184; median follow-up 92.5 days)\n- Intolerance events: 32 switchers; CK-based phenotype not analyzed (too few events).\n- Dose: 10 mg vs 5 mg associated with increased switching (HR 3.55; 95% CI 1.07\u201311.8; P=0.038), consistent with dose-dependent intolerance.\n- No significant association with:\n  - SLCO1B1 c.521T>C.\n  - ABCG2 c.421C>A.\n  - Combined risk allele count.\n- Short follow-up and small sample limited power; findings are consistent with previous rosuvastatin trial data that did not show SLCO1B1\u2013myalgia association.\n\nFluvastatin (n=70)\n- Intolerance events: 31 switchers.\n- No statistically significant associations for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, CYP2C9, or combined risk alleles.\n- Some non-significant trends:\n  - ABCG2 variant and CYP2C9 reduced function and higher combined risk allele count (2\u20134 alleles) showed HRs >1 (up to ~1.9) but with wide CIs crossing 1, suggesting possible effect consistent with prior transplant data but underpowered here.\n\nPravastatin (n=92; median follow-up >2 years)\n- Intolerance events: 29 switchers.\n- SLCO1B1 c.521T/C or C/C vs T/T:\n  - Statin switch: HR 2.11 (95% CI 1.01\u20134.39; P=0.047).\n- Doses were 20\u201340 mg (40 mg is the European maximum).\n- No CK-based phenotype analyzed for pravastatin (too few events).\n- This is notable because prior pravastatin safety data (short 16-week trial) did not show such an association; longer follow-up here may better capture late-onset intolerance.\n\nABCG2 and CYP2C9 overall\n- ABCG2 c.421C>A:\n  - No clear association with intolerance to atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, or pravastatin in this cohort.\n  - Pharmacokinetic effects seen in prior work did not translate into statistically robust clinical intolerance signals, likely due to limited power.\n- CYP2C9 (*2, *3):\n  - For fluvastatin, intermediate/poor metabolizers (vs normal) showed a non\u2011significant HR 1.36 for switching; not definitive.\n  - No strong signals of genotype\u2013intolerance association in this dataset.\n\nMethodological and conceptual points\n- Phenotype choice: The authors intentionally favored \u201cswitching\u201d (rather than discontinuation or dose reduction) as a marker of intolerance, based on preliminary analyses showing better agreement with SLCO1B1\u2013simvastatin associations and to minimize non\u2013intolerance reasons for changes.\n- The secondary \u201cswitch + CK\u201d phenotype enriched for suspected muscle toxicity (CK measured around the time of switch), capturing both CK-elevated myopathy and myalgias that prompt CK testing even if results are normal.\n- Administrative confounding: policy-driven switches from atorvastatin/rosuvastatin around 2006\u20132007 (due to reimbursement rules) were excluded to avoid bias.\n- Limitations:\n  - Epidemiologic, retrospective design; cannot prove causality.\n  - No direct clinical symptom data or CK values; only timing of CK testing.\n  - Small numbers for rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin limit precision.\n  - Single-country, mainly Finnish, so genotype frequencies and practice patterns may differ elsewhere.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics\n1) Simvastatin\n   - Findings strongly reinforce current CPIC recommendations: SLCO1B1 c.521C/C substantially increases real-world simvastatin intolerance, especially at higher doses.\n   - In practice, SLCO1B1 poor-function genotypes should prompt use of a lower-risk statin (e.g., pravastatin, rosuvastatin) or lower simvastatin doses with careful monitoring.\n\n2) Pravastatin\n   - SLCO1B1 c.521T>C also increases risk of pravastatin switching (HR ~2.1), suggesting that even \u201chydrophilic, non\u2013CYP\u2011metabolized\u201d pravastatin is not completely exempt from OATP1B1-related intolerance.\n   - Supports the inclusion of pravastatin in SLCO1B1-based statin choice algorithms, especially at 20\u201340 mg doses.\n\n3) Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin, Fluvastatin\n   - No statistically significant pharmacogenetic signals in this single cohort, but point estimates are directionally compatible with prior evidence for atorvastatin and fluvastatin.\n   - Data are valuable for meta-analyses and guideline refinement; current CPIC recommendations (cautious dosing or alternative statin in high SLCO1B1/ABCG2 risk genotypes, particularly at high doses) remain biologically plausible even if not conclusively supported here.\n\n4) Phenotyping strategy for real-world PGx\n   - The study demonstrates that combining prescription data (switches) with laboratory data (CK testing) is a feasible way to create scalable, registry-based pharmacogenomic phenotypes in the absence of structured clinical myopathy documentation.\n\nOverall conclusion\n- SLCO1B1 c.521T>C is clearly associated with increased real-world switching from simvastatin and pravastatin to other statins, supporting its role as a key determinant of statin intolerance beyond simvastatin alone.\n- No definitive additional associations were demonstrated for ABCG2 or CYP2C9 variants, or for atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin intolerance, largely due to power and dose limitations.\n- The register-based \u201cswitch\u201d and \u201cswitch + CK\u201d phenotypes appear valid and scalable for future large pharmacogenomic studies and can inform ongoing refinement of statin PGx prescribing guidelines.\n",
