    "summary": "Study objective:\nTo identify clinical and pharmacogenomic risk factors for adverse events\u2014especially hematologic toxicity\u2014during treatment with nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5\u2011fluorouracil and L\u2011leucovorin (nal\u2011IRI/FL) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, focusing on UGT1A1*6/*28 polymorphisms.\n\nDesign and population:\n- Single-center, retrospective cohort at Wakayama Medical University Hospital (Japan).\n- 36 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who initiated nal\u2011IRI/FL between June 2021 and May 2022.\n- UGT1A1 status: 16 wild\u2011type (\u2013/\u2013), 16 heterozygous (+/\u2013), 4 homozygous/compound heterozygous (+/+ for *6 or *28).\n\nTreatment and genotyping:\n- Regimen: nal\u2011IRI + 5\u2011FU + L\u2011leucovorin after prior gemcitabine-based therapy.\n- Dosing was at the physician\u2019s discretion; patients with UGT1A1*6/*28 (+/+) received significantly lower starting nal\u2011IRI doses than other genotypes.\n\nEndpoints and assessments:\n- Adverse events:\n  - Hematologic: nadir white blood cell (WBC) count, nadir neutrophil count; CTCAE v5.0 grading of leukopenia/neutropenia.\n  - Non\u2011hematologic: incidence of any\u2011grade diarrhea.\n- Baseline covariates: UGT1A1 genotype, liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin), renal function (eGFR), tumor location (e.g., pancreatic head vs others), and other clinical characteristics.\n\nKey results:\n1) UGT1A1 polymorphisms and hematologic toxicity\n- Nadir WBC counts (median [IQR], /mm\u00b3):\n  - UGT1A1 (\u2013/\u2013): 3,340 (2,950\u20135,120)\n  - UGT1A1 (+/\u2013): 3,220 (2,520\u20133,923)\n  - UGT1A1 (+/+): 2,050 (1,550\u20132,513)\n  - WBC nadir was significantly lower in UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) vs other groups (p=0.033).\n\n- Nadir neutrophil counts (median [IQR], /mm\u00b3):\n  - UGT1A1 (\u2013/\u2013): 1,930 (1,540\u20132,782)\n  - UGT1A1 (+/\u2013): 1,285 (1,093\u20132,113)\n  - UGT1A1 (+/+): 860 (407\u20131,616)\n  - Neutrophil nadir was significantly lower in UGT1A1 (+/+) (p=0.043).\n\n- Incidence of grade 3\u20134 leukopenia and neutropenia:\n  - UGT1A1 (\u2013/\u2013): ~7.1%\n  - UGT1A1 (+/\u2013): 12.5%\n  - UGT1A1 (+/+): 50.0%\n  - Differences showed a strong trend toward significance (p=0.085) despite the small (+/+) sample size.\n\n- Multiple regression analyses (continuous nadirs):\n  - Lower WBC nadir was independently associated with:\n    - UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) genotype (p=0.009)\n    - Higher baseline AST (p=0.019)\n    - Pancreatic head tumor location (p=0.030)\n  - Lower neutrophil nadir was independently associated with:\n    - UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) genotype (p=0.017)\n  - Total bilirubin was excluded from multivariable models due to collinearity with UGT1A1 genotype.\n\n2) Diarrhea\n- 7 patients were excluded from diarrhea analysis because they were on prophylactic loperamide from the start of nal\u2011IRI/FL.\n- Among 29 evaluable patients, incidence of any\u2011grade diarrhea:\n  - UGT1A1 (\u2013/\u2013): 27.3%\n  - UGT1A1 (+/\u2013): 21.4%\n  - UGT1A1 (+/+): 25.0%\n- Multivariate logistic regression did not identify any significant predictors of diarrhea, including UGT1A1 polymorphisms.\n\n3) Dosing and toxicity context\n- Overall incidence of grade \u22653 neutropenia (14.7%) was notably lower than reported in Japanese phase 2 data (~45.7%), likely reflecting more conservative or individualized dosing (especially dose reductions in UGT1A1 (+/+) patients).\n- Nevertheless, patients with UGT1A1*6/*28 (+/+) still had substantially more severe myelosuppression, supporting a strong pharmacogenomic effect even under reduced dosing.\n\nPharmacogenomic/PK interpretation:\n- UGT1A1*6 and *28 reduce glucuronidation of SN\u201138, the active irinotecan metabolite, increasing exposure and hematologic toxicity.\n- Prior phase I nal\u2011IRI studies and population PK analyses show:\n  - Higher SN\u201138 exposure and more severe neutropenia in *6/*28 or homozygous/compound heterozygous patients.\n  - Higher unencapsulated SN\u201138 Cmax in Asians vs Caucasians, which may contribute to the higher neutropenia risk in this Japanese cohort.\n- The current study\u2019s data, showing marked neutropenia in UGT1A1 (+/+) despite reduced starting doses, are consistent with this PK/PGx relationship.\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- UGT1A1-guided dosing:\n  - Patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) are at high risk of leukopenia and neutropenia on nal\u2011IRI/FL.\n  - Even with empiric dose reductions, these patients had markedly lower WBC/neutrophil nadirs and higher rates of grade 3\u20134 myelosuppression.\n  - The data support routine pre\u2011treatment UGT1A1 genotyping (at least for *6 and *28 in East Asian populations) and proactive dose adjustment and monitoring, in line with existing irinotecan pharmacogenomic guidance.\n\n- Non\u2011genetic risk factors for hematologic toxicity:\n  - Elevated baseline AST and pancreatic head tumor location were independent predictors of lower WBC nadir.\n  - These likely reflect impaired hepatobiliary function (e.g., biliary obstruction from pancreatic head tumors), which could reduce SN\u201138 clearance and increase unencapsulated SN\u201138 exposure, further enhancing myelosuppression.\n  - Clinically, patients with high AST or pancreatic head tumors may warrant more cautious initial nal\u2011IRI dosing and closer blood count monitoring, even if UGT1A1 is wild type or heterozygous.\n\n- Diarrhea risk:\n  - No significant relationship between UGT1A1 genotype or other measured variables and diarrhea was found, possibly due to small sample size and exclusion of patients receiving prophylactic loperamide.\n  - This contrasts with prior larger studies showing more severe diarrhea in UGT1A1 homozygotes/compound heterozygotes.\n\nLimitations:\n- Small, single-center, retrospective study; only 4 patients were UGT1A1 (+/+), limiting precision of effect estimates.\n- No pharmacokinetic sampling of irinotecan or SN\u201138 to directly relate toxicity to systemic exposures.\n- Heterogeneity in starting doses, reflecting real\u2011world practice but complicating quantitative dose\u2013toxicity interpretation.\n\nOverall conclusion (from a pharmacogenomics perspective):\n- UGT1A1*6/*28 homozygous or compound heterozygous genotype is a strong, independent risk factor for severe leukopenia and neutropenia in Japanese patients treated with nal\u2011IRI/FL, even under reduced dosing.\n- Elevated AST and pancreatic head tumor location appear to be additional non\u2011genetic predictors of leukopenia, likely via effects on hepatic/biliary handling of irinotecan/SN\u201138.\n- These findings support integrated risk stratification combining UGT1A1 genotyping with baseline liver function and tumor location to guide nal\u2011IRI dosing and monitoring in metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nTitle:\nRisk Factors for Adverse Events of Nanoliposomal Irinotecan Plus 5-Fluorouracil and L-leucovorin\n\nPMID:\n38707740\n\nPMCID:\nPMC11062152",
