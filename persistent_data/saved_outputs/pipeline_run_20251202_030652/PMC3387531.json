    "summary": "Study question and design:\n- Retrospective, multicenter case\u2013control toxicogenomic study of nevirapine-associated severe (grade III/IV) rash and/or hepatotoxicity.\n- HIV\u20111\u2013infected adults from 11 countries (African, Asian\u2014predominantly Thai\u2014and European ancestry), all with baseline CD4 >150 cells/\u00b5L.\n- Cases: symptomatic severe cutaneous and/or hepatic events within 8 weeks of starting nevirapine.\n- Stringently selected controls: >18 weeks on nevirapine without rash, hepatitis, or systemic hypersensitivity.\n- 1:2 matching on CD4 count, sex, and race.\n- Genotyping: 123 HLA alleles (class I and II) and 2,744 SNPs in MHC and ADME (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) genes.\n\nPopulation:\n- 276 evaluable cases (175 cutaneous, 101 hepatic; 74 had both) and 587 matched controls.\n- Racial groups: Black, Asian (74% Thai), and White (31% Hispanic/Latino).\n- ~70% had previous ART exposure; about half started nevirapine above current CD4 thresholds associated with increased toxicity.\n\nKey genetic associations \u2013 cutaneous (rash) toxicity:\n1. CYP2B6:\n   - Genome-wide toxicogenomic panel identified two CYP2B6 SNPs (rs2054675, rs3786547) associated with rash after multiple-testing correction.\n   - Both are in strong LD with CYP2B6 516G\u2192T (rs3745274), a known reduced-function allele that increases nevirapine exposure.\n   - CYP2B6 516G\u2192T showed an allele\u2013dose effect for rash:\n     \u2022 Blacks: strong trend; 516TT vs 516GG OR \u22485.9 (95% CI 1.53\u201326.8).\n     \u2022 Whites: significant trend.\n     \u2022 Asians: weaker trend when looking directly at 516G\u2192T, but association clearer via the linked SNPs.\n   - No CYP2B6 SNPs were associated with hepatic events after correction.\n\n2. HLA class I for cutaneous events:\n   - HLA-Cw*04:\n     \u2022 Significantly associated with rash in the pooled multi-ancestry analysis; strongest effects in Blacks and Asians.\n     \u2022 OR for rash \u22482.5 in the total cohort; OR increased when excluding individuals with both rash and hepatitis.\n   - HLA-B*35:\n     \u2022 Strongly associated with rash in Asians, especially Thais:\n       \u2013 Asians overall: OR ~3.5.\n       \u2013 Thais: OR ~5.6, rising further (~7.3) when focusing only on pure cutaneous cases.\n     \u2022 No robust association in Blacks or Whites, likely due to low allele frequency.\n   - Combined risk (epistasis):\n     \u2022 Asians carrying both HLA-B*35 and HLA-Cw*04 had very high rash risk (OR ~18.3, 95% CI 5.1\u201366), indicating a strong gene\u2013gene interaction.\n\n3. CYP2B6\u2013HLA interaction for rash:\n   - Across the total cohort, risk was highest when both impaired CYP2B6 metabolism and the key HLA allele were present:\n     \u2022 CYP2B6 516TT + HLA\u2011Cw*04: OR ~6.3 vs reference (CYP2B6 516GG and no HLA\u2011Cw*04), with similar patterns in Blacks and Asians.\n   - In Blacks specifically, combined CYP2B6 516TT + HLA\u2011Cw*04 gave an OR \u224818.9 for rash (based on stratified analyses), underscoring a potent combined effect.\n\nKey genetic associations \u2013 hepatic toxicity:\n1. HLA class II for hepatic events:\n   - HLA\u2011DRB1*01:\n     \u2022 Significant association with hepatic adverse events in Whites (OR ~3.0; increases to ~3.6 when restricting to isolated hepatic cases).\n     \u2022 This allele is infrequent in Blacks and rare in Asians, so power to detect associations in those groups was low.\n   - HLA\u2011DQB1*05:\n     \u2022 Initially associated with hepatic events in Whites, but signal disappeared when the analysis was restricted to isolated hepatic events, consistent with LD with HLA\u2011DRB1*01 rather than an independent effect.\n   - No robust HLA signal for hepatic events in Blacks or Asians.\n\n2. Absence of CYP2B6 effect on liver toxicity:\n   - No CYP2B6 SNP, including 516G\u2192T, was associated with hepatic adverse events after correction.\n   - This supports a mechanistic distinction: hepatic toxicity appears not to depend on the CYP2B6-mediated kinetic profile of nevirapine.\n\nOther loci and previous candidates:\n- No SNPs in sulfotransferase/sulfatase genes (129 SNPs in 11 genes) survived correction, despite mechanistic plausibility from animal work (12-hydroxy-nevirapine sulfation \u2192 reactive metabolite in skin).\n- ABCB1 3435C\u2192T:\n  - No statistically significant association with rash or hepatotoxicity in any group after correction.\n  - In Blacks, the OR for hepatotoxicity (~0.5 for the T allele) was directionally consistent with prior African studies but underpowered.\n- HLA\u2011Cw*08:\n  - Previously linked to nevirapine hypersensitivity in Sardinia and Japan; not associated with either cutaneous or hepatic events in this multi-ancestry cohort.\n\nAncestry-specific patterns:\n- Asians (especially Thais): strong class I (HLA-B*35, HLA\u2011Cw*04)\u2013driven rash risk, with high ORs and important gene\u2013gene interactions.\n- Blacks: prominent role for CYP2B6 516G\u2192T and HLA-Cw*04 in rash; very high risk when both are present.\n- Whites: rash modestly associated with HLA-Cw*04 (weak for HLA-B*35); hepatotoxicity strongly associated with HLA-DRB1*01.\n- Differences in association patterns are partly explained by varying allele frequencies across populations.\n\nMechanistic interpretation:\n- Cutaneous toxicity:\n  - Strong association with HLA class I alleles (HLA-B*35, HLA-Cw*04) plus CYP2B6 loss-of-function suggests an MHC class I\u2013restricted, CD8 T\u2011cell\u2013mediated hypersensitivity mechanism modulated by nevirapine biotransformation.\n  - CYP2B6 516G\u2192T may alter the balance between parent drug and reactive metabolites (e.g., 12\u2011hydroxy nevirapine \u2192 sulfate \u2192 quinone methide), increasing the availability of neoantigenic species presented by risk HLA molecules in skin.\n\n- Hepatic toxicity:\n  - Dominant association with HLA-DRB1*01 (class II) and lack of CYP2B6 effect indicates a distinct, MHC class II\u2013restricted, CD4 T\u2011cell\u2013driven immunopathogenesis that does not depend on CYP2B6-mediated kinetics.\n  - Consistent with prior Australian data linking HLA\u2011DRB1*0101 to nevirapine-related hepatic/systemic hypersensitivity.\n\nClinical variables:\n- Matching on CD4 count, sex, and race prevented evaluation of those factors as independent predictors.\n- In multivariable models adjusting for HLA-Cw*04 and CYP2B6 516G\u2192T, the only clinical predictor of rash was prior ART exposure (OR ~0.57 for ART-experienced vs na\u00efve), suggesting somewhat lower rash risk in treatment-experienced patients.\n- Prior abacavir exposure in Whites was weakly protective against rash, independent of HLA/CYP2B6, but this was exploratory and may reflect selection or survivor bias.\n\nSensitivity and clinical utility of pharmacogenetic screening:\n- Despite convincingly significant associations and large ORs in some strata, the overall sensitivity of the identified variants is too low for routine clinical use:\n  - ~80% of Asians with rash were HLA\u2011B*35 negative.\n  - ~62% of all rash cases were HLA\u2011Cw*04 negative.\n  - ~56% of White hepatic cases lacked HLA\u2011DRB1*01.\n  - ~48% of all adverse event cases carried none of the key HLA risk alleles (HLA\u2011Cw*04, HLA\u2011B*35, HLA\u2011DRB1*01) and were not CYP2B6 516TT.\n- These markers would fail to identify most patients destined to develop serious nevirapine toxicity and thus are not suitable as stand-alone pre-prescription screening tools, in contrast to HLA\u2011B*57:01 for abacavir.\n\nLimitations:\n- Retrospective case identification and exclusion of mild or ambiguous events limit generalizability to moderate toxicity and preclude assessment of fatal cases.\n- CD4-based matching means the study cannot re-evaluate the well-known CD4 threshold effect.\n- High CD4 eligibility (>150 cells/\u00b5L) restricts extrapolation to patients with advanced immunosuppression.\n- HLA typed at intermediate resolution; high-resolution typing might refine specific alleles/haplotypes and ORs, but is unlikely to substantially improve sensitivity.\n- Focused on MHC and ADME genes; other immune, inflammatory, or liver injury pathways were not systematically interrogated.\n\nOverall conclusions and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- Both drug metabolism (CYP2B6) and immune recognition (HLA) influence risk of nevirapine-associated severe cutaneous and hepatic adverse events, with distinct genetic architectures and mechanisms for skin versus liver injury.\n- Cutaneous reactions appear to be:\n  - Predominantly MHC class I\u2013mediated (HLA-B*35, HLA\u2011Cw*04),\n  - Modulated by CYP2B6 516G\u2192T (altered nevirapine metabolism),\n  - Strongly shaped by ancestry-specific allele distributions.\n- Hepatic reactions appear to be:\n  - Predominantly MHC class II\u2013mediated (HLA\u2011DRB1*01, and linked HLA\u2011DQB1*05),\n  - Largely independent of CYP2B6 genotype and, by implication, parent drug exposure.\n- From a clinical standpoint, existing CD4-based prescribing restrictions likely remain more impactful than any available pharmacogenetic test for nevirapine hypersensitivity. The identified variants are mechanistically informative but, because of poor sensitivity, do not justify routine pre-treatment genetic screening.\n- Future work should seek additional risk variants (likely outside classical MHC/ADME loci), integrate multi-allelic risk scores, and elucidate specific drug\u2013HLA\u2013peptide interactions underlying these reactions.\n",
