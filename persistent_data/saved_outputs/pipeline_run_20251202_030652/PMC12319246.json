    "summary": "Design and cohort:\n- Single-center retrospective pharmacogenetic study of 79 adult kidney transplant recipients transplanted 2008\u20132009, all on tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, with 12 years of follow-up.\n- Genotyped 37 SNPs in 14 ADME pharmacogenes in both donors and recipients (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, TPMT, UGT1A9, ABCB1, ABCC2, SLCO1B1, NOD2, etc.).\n- Outcomes: overall survival, de novo tumors, acute and chronic rejection, nephrotoxicity, re-transplantation, renal function (eGFR), infections, de novo diabetes, and tacrolimus dose-normalized troughs (C0/D) over time.\n- Analyses: multivariate logistic regression (all SNPs + age + sex), FDR correction, Kaplan\u2013Meier for survival/tumors, and genotype-stratified tacrolimus C0/D and eGFR curves.\n\nKey pharmacogenetic associations\n\n1) Survival (12\u2011year)\n- Donor ABCB1 rs9282564 AA: associated with reduced risk of death (OR \u2248 0.12; FDR\u2011significant). AG donors had lower Kaplan\u2013Meier survival than AA.\n- Donor ABCC2 rs2273697 GA: associated with increased death risk (OR \u2248 4.1; FDR\u2011significant). Kaplan\u2013Meier showed best survival with donor GG vs AA/GA.\n- CYP3A5 rs776746 (recipient) and CYP2B6 rs3745274 (recipient) appeared in logistic models pre\u2011FDR but did not remain FDR\u2011significant for death, though curves suggested better late survival for CYP3A5 *3/*3.\n\n2) Tumor incidence\n- Recipient CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT: associated with markedly lower tumor risk (OR \u2248 0.10, FDR\u2011significant). The variant thus appears protective against de novo malignancy.\n- Donor ABCC2 rs2273697 AA and GA: associated with higher tumor risk (AA OR \u2248 13; GA OR \u2248 3.4).\n- Donor ABCB1 rs9282564 AA: associated with lower tumor risk (OR \u2248 0.12).\n\n3) Rejection, nephrotoxicity, re\u2011transplantation (renal outcomes)\n- Chronic rejection\n  - Donor ABCB1 rs2235013 GA: protective (OR \u2248 0.13).\n\n- Acute rejection\n  - Recipient CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA: protective (OR \u2248 0.08).\n  - Recipient SLCO1B1 rs4149056 TT: protective (OR \u2248 0.16).\n  - Donor CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT: protective (OR \u2248 0.20).\n  - Donor UGT1A9 rs6714486 TA: associated with much higher acute rejection risk (OR > 30, but based on small, imbalanced numbers).\n\n- Nephrotoxicity\n  - Recipient SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AA and AG: strongly protective (OR \u2248 0.08 and 0.23, respectively); donor SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AG also protective (OR \u2248 0.11).\n  - Donor NOD2 rs2066844 CC: protective (OR \u2248 0.02), with no clear C0/D effect.\n  - Donor CYP2C19 rs4244285 AA (*2 poor metabolizer): greatly increased nephrotoxicity risk (OR \u2248 11.7), paralleling very high tacrolimus C0/D.\n\n- Re\u2011transplantation\n  - Donor TPMT rs1142345 AA and donor CYP2C9 rs1799853 CC: both associated with reduced re\u2011transplantation risk (OR \u2248 0.05 and 0.10, respectively); mechanistic basis is unclear and numbers are small.\n\n4) Diabetes and infections\n- De novo diabetes mellitus\n  - Recipient CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT: trend toward protection (OR \u2248 0.27, p = FDR threshold 0.056), consistent with lower diabetes risk but borderline.\n\n- Infections\n  - Recipient ABCB1 rs1045642 CC: reduced severe infection risk (OR \u2248 0.09).\n  - Donor ABCB1 rs9282564 AA: markedly increased infection risk (OR \u2248 23.8), despite being protective for survival and tumors\u2014suggesting complex, context\u2011dependent effects.\n\nEffects on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics (C0/D) and link to toxicity/outcomes\n\n- CYP3A4 rs2740574 (recipient)\n  - AA: substantially higher C0/D than GA across 12 years (often ~2\u2011fold difference; >200 vs ~100 ng/mL\u00b7kg/mg from year 6 onward). This is consistent with literature that *1/*1 (AA) associates with higher exposure. Higher exposure likely underlies reduced acute rejection risk and better eGFR.\n\n- CYP3A5 rs776746 (recipient and donor)\n  - *3/*3 (GG): non\u2011expressers had significantly higher C0/D (often >200 ng/mL\u00b7kg/mg) vs *1/*3 (GA), whose C0/D stayed ~100. This matches CPIC/DPWG guidance that *3/*3 requires lower starting tacrolimus doses.\n\n- CYP2C19 rs4244285 (donor)\n  - AA (*2/*2): recipients displayed very high tacrolimus C0/D (>300 ng/mL\u00b7kg/mg) from ~year 3 onward compared with GG/GA donors. This poor-metabolizer status plus co-administered omeprazole (a CYP2C19 substrate) likely shifts metabolism toward CYP3A5, saturating tacrolimus clearance and driving nephrotoxicity.\n\n- ABCB1 (recipient and donor)\n  - Recipient rs1045642 TT and rs2235033 TT: higher tacrolimus C0/D than other genotypes; consistent with decreased efflux and higher systemic exposure, which may help prevent rejection but also increase toxicity risk.\n  - Donor rs2235013 GG: lower and more stable tacrolimus C0/D (~100 ng/mL\u00b7kg/mg) in recipients.\n\n- SLCO1B1\n  - Recipient rs4149056 TT: nearly double tacrolimus C0/D vs TC from year 3 onward, aligning with reduced transporter function and protective effect against acute rejection.\n  - Donor rs2306283 AA vs GG: early post\u2011transplant significant C0/D differences, diminishing over time. AA genotypes in donors and recipients were protective against nephrotoxicity, likely via lower tissue exposure.\n\nImpact on renal function (eGFR)\n\n- Across genotypes, eGFR rose from <10 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 at transplant to ~50\u201360 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 at 1 year, with genotype\u2011dependent patterns thereafter.\n\nMetabolizing genes:\n- Recipient CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA: better early and sustained eGFR than GA (\u224860 vs 45 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2; p < 0.001), consistent with better overall exposure control.\n- Donor CYP3A5 rs776746 *3/*3: higher eGFR vs *1/*3 from 9\u201312 months onward.\n- Recipient CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT: higher eGFR compared with TT; donor TT was associated with delayed and lower eGFR recovery vs GT.\n\nTransporter genes:\n- Recipient ABCB1 rs1045642 CC: fastest and best eGFR recovery, maintained >60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2, superior to CT/TT.\n- Donor ABCC2 rs2273697 GG: consistently higher eGFR (~60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2) than other genotypes from week 1 onward, paralleling its favorable survival and low tumor risk.\n\nGene\u2013gene interactions\n\nThe study explicitly tested interactions between metabolism and transporter variants, highlighting that combined genotypes often had stronger predictive value than single SNPs:\n- ABCC2\u2013CYP2C19 (donor\u2013donor): GG at ABCC2 rs2273697 plus AG or AA at CYP2C19 rs4244285 reduced tumor risk (OR < 0.2).\n- CYP2B6\u2013ABCC2 (recipient\u2013donor): GA in CYP2B6 rs2279343 (recipient) plus GG in donor ABCC2 rs2273697 increased tumor risk (OR ~5.3).\n- CYP2B6\u2013ABCB1 (donor\u2013recipient): donor CYP2B6 rs3745274 TT plus recipient ABCB1 rs1045642 TC raised acute rejection risk; donor TT plus recipient ABCB1 rs2235033 TC increased nephrotoxicity risk (OR ~7.5).\n- CYP2B6\u2013SLCO1B1 (donor\u2013donor): donor CYP2B6 rs3745274 TT plus donor SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AG increased de novo diabetes risk (OR ~9.8).\n- CYP3A5\u2013ABCB1/SLCO1B1 (recipient\u2013donor): recipient CYP3A5 *1/*3 (GA) combined with donor ABCB1 rs2235013 GA or donor SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AG increased mortality risk (OR ~6.4).\n\nInterpretation and clinical implications\n\n- The study extends the tacrolimus pharmacogenetic evidence base beyond CYP3A5 by:\n  - Showing long-term links between known metabolism/transport SNPs (CYP3A5, CYP3A4, ABCB1, ABCC2, SLCO1B1, CYP2C19) and hard outcomes: 12\u2011year survival, tumors, nephrotoxicity, rejection, infections, and graft function.\n  - Highlighting clinically plausible mechanistic chains: variants that increase tacrolimus exposure (e.g., CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA, CYP3A5 *3/*3, SLCO1B1 rs4149056 TT, CYP2C19 *2 in the donor) associate with both beneficial (less rejection, better survival) and harmful effects (nephrotoxicity, infections, tumors) depending on the balance of under\u2011 vs over\u2011immunosuppression.\n  - Identifying previously underexplored genes (CYP2B6, SLCO1B1, ABCC2, NOD2) as potential contributors to long-term clinical evolution.\n\n- From a translational perspective:\n  - The data support pre\u2011transplant genotyping of both donor and recipient for a broad ADME panel (not only CYP3A5), particularly ABCB1, ABCC2, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, SLCO1B1, CYP2C19.\n  - For high\u2011risk genotypes (e.g., CYP2C19 *2 donors combined with omeprazole therapy, or SLCO1B1 loss\u2011of\u2011function, or unfavorable ABCC2/ABCB1 profiles), closer therapeutic drug monitoring, earlier dose adjustment, or alternative co\u2011medications may be warranted.\n  - Multi\u2011gene and gene\u2013gene interaction models may outperform single\u2011SNP approaches for predicting late complications.\n\nLimitations\n\n- Modest cohort size (n=79) and single-center, largely homogeneous population limit power and generalizability.\n- Many odds ratios have wide confidence intervals, especially for rare genotypes; some extreme ORs likely reflect small cell counts.\n- Tacrolimus exposure and clinical decisions were not prospectively guided by genotype, so causal inferences remain hypothesis\u2011generating.\n\nOverall conclusion\n\nThis 12\u2011year follow\u2011up study indicates that both donor and recipient pharmacogene variants in tacrolimus metabolism/transport pathways are associated with long-term survival, graft function, malignancy, nephrotoxicity, rejection, infections, and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in kidney transplant recipients. Findings corroborate the importance of CYP3A5 and extend relevance to CYP3A4, ABCB1, ABCC2, CYP2C19, SLCO1B1, CYP2B6 and others. Broad pre\u2011transplant pharmacogenetic testing, interpreted via multi\u2011gene models and integrated with therapeutic drug monitoring, could improve individualized immunosuppression, but larger multicenter validation is needed before routine implementation.\n",
