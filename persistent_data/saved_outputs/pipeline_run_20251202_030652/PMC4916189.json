    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis ENCORE1 pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic\u2013pharmacogenetic substudy evaluated whether efavirenz 400 mg once daily (EFV400) maintains virologic efficacy at 96 weeks despite lower plasma concentrations than the standard 600 mg dose (EFV600), and how pharmacokinetics and key genetic variants in drug-metabolizing enzymes/transporters relate to efficacy, toxicity, and treatment discontinuation.\n\nPopulation and methods:\n- 606 treatment\u2011na\u00efve HIV\u2011infected adults from 38 sites worldwide (37% African, 33% Asian; 32% female) on tenofovir/emtricitabine plus randomized EFV400 (n=311) or EFV600 (n=295).\n- Population PK model based on sparse and intensive sampling at weeks 4\u201312 estimated individual EFV AUC24, Cmax, C24, and C12.\n- Genotyping: CYP2B6 (516G>T, 983T>C, 15582C>T), CYP2A6 (*9B, *17), CYP3A4*22, NR1I3 (CAR 540C>T, 1089T>C), NR1I2 (PXR 63396C>T, 7635A>G), ABCB1 3435C>T.\n- Primary PD endpoint: HIV RNA <200 copies/mL at week 96.\n- Safety endpoints: EFV discontinuation (>30 d interruption), overall EFV\u2011related adverse events (AEs), CNS AEs, and discontinuation due to EFV\u2011related AEs.\n- Also tested validity of the widely used efavirenz \u201cminimum effective concentration\u201d (MEC) of 1.0 mg/L (mid\u2011interval C12).\n\nKey efficacy findings:\n- Virologic suppression was very high and similar between doses at week 96:\n  - EFV400: 97% <200 copies/mL\n  - EFV600: 99% <200 copies/mL (p=0.091)\n- Only 2% (13/575 with available VL) had pVL \u2265200 copies/mL at week 96.\n- No EFV PK parameter (AUC24, Cmax, C24, C12) was significantly associated with achieving pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks in logistic regression; effect estimates were imprecise due to the very low failure rate.\n- None of the tested SNPs, nor metabolizer status defined by composite CYP2B6/CYP2A6 genotypes, was associated with virologic failure.\n\nToxicity and discontinuation:\n- Overall EFV discontinuation to 96 weeks was 12% (11% EFV400 vs 13% EFV600; p=0.395).\n- EFV-related AEs were more frequent with EFV600:\n  - EFV\u2011related AEs (per Stocrin PI): 73% EFV600 vs 66% EFV400 (p=0.043).\n  - EFV\u2011related AEs (clinician-attributed): 46% EFV600 vs 38% EFV400 (p=0.048).\n  - Discontinuation due to EFV\u2011related AE (clinician decision): 8% EFV600 vs 3% EFV400 (p=0.019).\n- EFV dose (600 vs 400 mg) independently predicted stopping due to EFV\u2011related AEs (HR\u22482.5; 95% CI ~1.2\u20135.4).\n- CNS AEs (abnormal dreams, insomnia, dizziness, etc.) were common but similar by dose (42% EFV400 vs 46% EFV600, p=0.287) and were not explained by EFV plasma levels.\n\nPK\u2013toxicity relationships:\n- Paradoxically, patients who discontinued or stopped for EFV\u2011related AEs tended to have *lower* EFV exposure:\n  - Overall discontinuation: AUC24, Cmax, C12 ~14\u201316% lower in non\u2011discontinuers.\n  - Stopping due to EFV\u2011related AEs: AUC24 and C12 ~19\u201322% lower in non\u2011stoppers.\n- However, EFV concentrations were *not* associated with CNS AEs; PK metrics did not differ meaningfully between those with and without CNS toxicity.\n\nPharmacogenetic findings (safety/discontinuation):\n1. Overall EFV discontinuation (time\u2011to\u2011event Cox models adjusted for age, sex, country, dose):\n   - Increased risk:\n     - CYP2B6 516 GT: HR ~1.8 vs GG.\n     - CYP2B6 516 TT: HR ~2.7 vs GG.\n     - CYP2A6*9B CA/AA: HR ~2.0 vs CC.\n   - Decreased risk:\n     - NR1I2 63396 TT: HR ~0.2 vs CC (\u224878% lower risk of discontinuation).\n   - ABCB1 3435C>T and most other SNPs did not consistently predict overall discontinuation after full adjustment.\n\n2. CNS AEs (multivariable logistic models):\n   - Decreased risk of CNS AEs:\n     - CYP2B6 983 TC/CC: OR ~0.3 (\u224865\u201370% lower risk) vs TT.\n   - Increased risk of CNS AEs:\n     - CYP2B6 15582 CT/TT: OR ~1.6 vs CC.\n     - ABCB1 3435 TT: OR ~2.1 vs CC.\n   - These associations suggest that CYP2B6 and ABCB1 variants modulate CNS tolerability, likely via effects on formation and CNS penetration/clearance of toxic efavirenz metabolites (e.g., 8\u2011hydroxy\u2011efavirenz), rather than via the parent EFV concentration.\n\n3. EFV\u2011related AEs (overall):\n   - After multivariable adjustment, specific SNPs did not retain significant associations with the composite EFV\u2011related AE endpoints, except via their effects on discontinuation and CNS AEs noted above.\n\nRe\u2011evaluation of the 1.0 mg/L MEC:\n- Using model\u2011predicted C12 at weeks 4\u201312:\n  - pVL \u2265200 copies/mL at week 96\n    - C12 \u22651.0 mg/L: 2% (11/557)\n    - C12 <1.0 mg/L: 11% (2/18; 2 further with missing VL; p=0.059).\n  - Sensitivity/specificity of C12=1.0 mg/L for week\u201196 pVL <200 copies/mL: 97.1% / 84.6% (LR\u22486).\n- ROC analysis showed multiple candidate C12 cutoffs with sensitivity and specificity both >90% in the ~0.47\u20130.76 mg/L range, implying:\n  - A single, sharp MEC is statistically weak in this setting.\n  - Values substantially below 1.0 mg/L still predict high likelihood of long\u2011term suppression, especially in adherent patients.\n- Because only 2% had virologic failure, the power to define any robust MEC is low, and PK at week 4\u201312 may not fully reflect exposures at week 96. Nonetheless, the data strongly question the clinical relevance of the traditional EFV MEC of 1.0 mg/L in modern, potent backbone regimens.\n\nInterpretation and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- EFV400 maintained non\u2011inferior virologic suppression to 96 weeks despite lower systemic exposure across all genotypes and metabolizer categories.\n- Neither \u201csubtherapeutic\u201d concentrations (by old MEC criteria) nor the genotypes tested (CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP3A4*22, ABCB1, NR1I3, NR1I2) predicted virologic failure in this well\u2011adherent, treatment\u2011na\u00efve cohort.\n- Polymorphisms in CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 primarily affected EFV exposure and overall discontinuation risk, and selectively influenced CNS toxicity (CYP2B6 983, 15582), but these effects did not negate the efficacy advantage of EFV400.\n- ABCB1 3435 TT\u2014despite EFV itself not being a P\u2011gp substrate\u2014was associated with significantly higher CNS AEs, possibly via altered transport of the neurotoxic 8\u2011hydroxy\u2011efavirenz metabolite across the blood\u2013brain barrier.\n- NR1I2 63396 TT appeared protective against discontinuation, likely reflecting increased pregnane X receptor (PXR) activity, enhanced CYP3A4 expression, and slightly lower EFV exposure.\n\nClinical and public\u2011health conclusions:\n- EFV400 once daily is pharmacodynamically adequate for long\u2011term viral suppression across diverse ethnicities and pharmacogenetic backgrounds.\n- EFV600\u2019s higher rate of EFV\u2011related AEs and AE\u2011driven discontinuations is largely dose\u2011driven and not explained by the polymorphisms examined.\n- Routine EFV therapeutic drug monitoring to target a fixed \u201cMEC\u201d (1.0 mg/L) is not supported by this dataset, especially in resource\u2011limited settings.\n- Implementing EFV dose reduction to 400 mg could:\n  - Reduce CNS and other EFV\u2011related toxicities and discontinuations.\n  - Maintain excellent virologic efficacy.\n  - Lower drug costs and potentially expand ART coverage.\n- Additional PK/PD work is still needed before applying EFV400 in specific high\u2011risk groups (e.g., pregnancy, concomitant rifampicin\u2011based TB therapy), but ENCORE1 provides strong justification that, for typical ART\u2011na\u00efve adults, EFV400 is an effective and more tolerable dose.\n\nIn essence, this comprehensive 96\u2011week PK/PD/pharmacogenetic analysis shows that interindividual PK variability and genetic polymorphisms in EFV metabolism/transport do not compromise the effectiveness of EFV400, while toxicities\u2014particularly CNS AEs and AE\u2011driven discontinuations\u2014are substantially reduced compared with EFV600.\n",
