    "summary": "This case\u2013control pharmacogenomic study in Han Chinese demonstrates an extremely strong association between the HLA\u2011B*5801 allele and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) caused by allopurinol, including drug hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\n\nStudy design and population:\n- 51 unrelated Han Chinese patients with allopurinol\u2011induced SCAR (13 SJS, 5 SJS/TEN overlap, 3 TEN, 30 HSS) recruited from multiple hospitals in Taiwan.\n- Two control groups:\n  - 135 allopurinol\u2011tolerant gout/hyperuricemia patients (\u22656 months\u2019 exposure, median 22 months, no adverse reactions).\n  - 93 healthy Han Chinese from a population biobank.\n- All SCAR cases had onset within 3 months of starting allopurinol, and causality was supported by resolution after withdrawal and (in a few) recurrence on re\u2011exposure.\n\nGenetic methods:\n- Initial screen: 823 SNPs in drug metabolism and immune-related genes, including 197 SNPs across the MHC region (6p21.3), genotyped by MALDI\u2011TOF.\n- Follow\u2011up: classical HLA typing (A, B, C, DRB1) with sequence\u2011specific oligonucleotide line blot and sequencing-based typing.\n- Association testing used Cochran\u2013Armitage trend test for SNPs and Fisher\u2019s exact test for HLA alleles; multiple-testing correction by Bonferroni.\n\nKey findings:\n1. MHC region signal:\n- In the SNP screen, 29 SNPs in the MHC region showed significant association with allopurinol\u2011SCAR.\n- Three class III region SNPs had P < 10\u207b\u2077: rs3117583 (BAT3), rs1150793 (MSH5), rs2855804 (MICB), indicating a strong MHC linkage.\n- Outside MHC, weak signals were observed at CFLAR (Casp8/FADD\u2011like apoptosis regulator) but not replicated for KIR2DL1.\n\n2. HLA-B*5801 association:\n- HLA\u2011B*5801 was present in 100% (51/51) of allopurinol\u2011SCAR patients.\n- Frequency in controls:\n  - 15% (20/135) of allopurinol\u2011tolerant patients.\n  - 20% (19/93) of population controls.\n- Effect estimates:\n  - vs tolerant controls: OR 580.3 (95% CI 34.4\u20139780.9), Pc = 4.7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2074.\n  - vs population controls: OR 393.5 (95% CI 23.2\u20136665.3), Pc = 8.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2078.\n- HLA\u2011B*5801 was not associated with the underlying diseases (e.g., gout, renal impairment) themselves.\n- The presence of B*5801 appears necessary but not sufficient: many tolerant patients also carried the allele.\n\n3. Extended HLA haplotype:\n- Additional alleles enriched in cases: HLA\u2011A*3303, Cw*0302, DRB1*0301.\n- A conserved extended haplotype was defined as A*3303\u2013Cw*0302\u2013B*5801\u2013DRB1*0301.\n- Frequencies of B*5801-linked markers:\n  - Cw*0302: 94% of SCAR vs 14% tolerant and 20% general population (OR ~98 vs tolerant).\n  - A*3303: 67% vs 18% vs 22%.\n  - DRB1*0301: 65% vs 13% vs 15%.\n- Full extended haplotype (A*3303\u2013Cw*0302\u2013B*5801\u2013DRB1*0301): present in 41% of SCAR patients vs 7% tolerant and 10% general controls.\n\n4. Clinical covariates and co\u2011risk factors:\n- Chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine \u22651.7 mg/dL \u22656 months) was significantly more frequent in SCAR cases (55%) than tolerant controls (21%), with OR 4.7 (95% CI ~2.3\u20139.3), confirming renal insufficiency as an independent clinical risk factor.\n- All SCAR cases developed reactions within 3 months of starting allopurinol; in three patients, re\u2011exposure caused rapid recurrence.\n- Thiazide use was similar between groups and not significantly associated.\n- SCAR patients overall received lower median daily allopurinol doses but for a much shorter duration than tolerant controls, consistent with acute intolerance rather than dose\u2011dependent toxicity.\n\nPharmacogenomic interpretation and implications:\n- This study identifies HLA\u2011B*5801 as a powerful genetic marker of susceptibility to allopurinol\u2011induced SCAR in Han Chinese, with effect sizes surpassing many classical HLA\u2013disease associations (e.g., HLA\u2011B27 and ankylosing spondylitis).\n- Because B*5801 is present in a significant minority of the general Han Chinese population (~15\u201320%), pre\u2011treatment HLA\u2011B*5801 screening could be an effective strategy to prevent allopurinol\u2011induced SCAR in this population, particularly in patients with additional risk factors such as chronic kidney disease.\n- However, not all B*5801 carriers develop SCAR when exposed to allopurinol, indicating that B*5801 is necessary but not sufficient. Non\u2011genetic modifiers (renal function, possibly infections) and additional genetic loci (e.g., CFLAR) may modulate risk.\n- Mechanistically, the authors propose that specific HLA\u2011B molecules (here B*5801; previously B*1502 for carbamazepine SJS/TEN and B*5701 for abacavir hypersensitivity) may present the culprit drug or its reactive metabolite as a neo\u2011antigenic peptide to T cells, initiating a cytotoxic immune response that underlies SCAR.\n\nClinical relevance for pharmacogenomics:\n- This landmark study, along with later confirmatory work, underpins current guideline recommendations (e.g., CPIC, many Asian rheumatology/dermatology societies) to avoid starting allopurinol in HLA\u2011B*5801\u2013positive Han Chinese and several other high\u2011prevalence Asian populations.\n- For patients with gout or hyperuricemia who carry HLA\u2011B*5801, alternative urate\u2011lowering therapy should be considered (e.g., febuxostat, uricosurics where appropriate), especially when renal insufficiency is present.\n\nTitle: \u201cHLA-B*5801 allele as a genetic marker for severe cutaneous adverse reactions caused by allopurinol\u201d\n\nPMID: 15743917\n\nPMCID: PMC554812",
