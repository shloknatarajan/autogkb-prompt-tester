    "summary": "Study design and population:\n- Retrospective nested case\u2013control pharmacogenomic study in 82 Chilean patients with advanced (stage III\u2013IV) colorectal adenocarcinoma treated first\u2011line with 5\u2011FU/capecitabine\u2011based regimens (mainly FOLFOX or CAPOX; many with oxaliplatin). \n- Sixteen pre\u2011selected variants were genotyped in 10 genes involved in 5\u2011FU activation/inactivation, folate cycle, oxaliplatin detoxification and DNA repair, and drug transport: TYMS, TYMP, DPYD, GSTP1, MTHFR, ERCC2, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC4, ABCG2.\n- Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were abstracted cycle\u2011by\u2011cycle from clinical records and graded using CTCAE v5.0, then grouped into system categories (GI, hematologic, nervous system, skin/subcutaneous, fatigue, pain) and also analyzed as individual toxicities (e.g., neuropathy, mucositis, anemia).\n\nKey pharmacogenetic findings (univariate):\n1. TYMS 3\u2032UTR 6\u2011bp ins/del (rs11280056)\n- DEL carriers had substantially *lower* risk of toxicity:\n  - Gastrointestinal disorders: DEL/DEL vs INS/INS OR\u22480.10 (p\u22480.045).\n  - Hematologic disorders: very strong protection\n    - INS/DEL vs INS/INS OR 0.16 (p=0.002), DEL/DEL vs INS/INS OR 0.03 (p=0.001).\n    - Dominant model (any DEL vs INS/INS) OR 0.11 (p<0.0001); recessive DEL/DEL OR 0.08 (p=0.015).\n  - Severe (grade 3\u20134) hematologic toxicity: DEL carriers also protected (dominant OR\u22480.10; p=0.005).\n- This is directionally opposite to some prior reports linking this variant to higher toxicity, suggesting possible population\u2011specific effects or limited power in earlier studies.\n\n2. TYMS 5\u2032UTR TSER VNTR (2R/3R, rs45445694)\n- 3R/3R genotype increased risk of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\n  - Recessive model (3R/3R vs 2R/2R + 2R/3R): OR 6.40 (p=0.029).\n- Reinforces that TYMS expression variants can influence non\u2011hematologic toxicity patterns under fluoropyrimidines.\n\n3. DPYD c.85T>C (DPYD*9, rs1801265)\n- High\u2011frequency DPYD variant (C allele present in ~40% of cohort) that does *not* cause classic complete DPD deficiency.\n- C allele associated with greater neuropathy risk:\n  - Dominant model (T/C + C/C vs T/T) OR 4.58 (p=0.05).\n  - More extreme effect seen in codominant analysis (T/C OR 30; p=0.0049) in ungrouped ADR analysis (neuropathy specifically).\n- Foundational evidence that common, non\u2013loss\u2011of\u2011function DPYD variants may still modulate neurotoxicity risk in 5\u2011FU/oxaliplatin settings.\n\n4. GSTP1 c.313A>G (rs1695)\n- Key enzyme in glutathione\u2011mediated detoxification of oxaliplatin.\n- G allele had *dual* and directionally opposite effects:\n  - Protective against hematologic toxicity:\n    - Dominant (A/G+G/G vs A/A): OR 0.30 (p=0.001).\n    - Recessive (G/G vs A/A+A/G): OR 0.16 (p=0.0005).\n  - Protective against nervous system disorders overall and specifically neuropathy:\n    - Recessive (G/G) for nervous system disorders: OR 0.18 (p=0.020).\n    - For neuropathy as an individual ADR (supplementary): OR\u22480.01 (p=0.008), i.e., very strong protection.\n  - *Increased* risk of mucositis (GI mucosal toxicity): OR 2.27 (p=0.036).\n- This split phenotype (less neuropathy, more mucositis) is novel and suggests tissue\u2011specific impact of altered GSTP1 activity on 5\u2011FU/oxaliplatin disposition and local damage.\n\n5. ERCC2 (XPD) c.2251A>C (rs13181)\n- DNA repair gene involved in nucleotide excision repair, relevant for oxaliplatin\u2011induced DNA adduct repair.\n- C/C genotype associated with *lower* risk of GI disorders (codominant model, OR 0.10; p=0.045).\n- In multivariate analysis (see below), ERCC2 C/C instead emerged as a *risk factor* for pain, underscoring that effects may differ by toxicity domain.\n\n6. TYMP (TP) c.1412C>T (rs11479)\n- Missense variant in thymidine phosphorylase, involved in capecitabine \u2192 5\u2011FU activation and in 5\u2011FU activation cascade.\n- T allele (C/T + T/T) increased risk of pain:\n  - Dominant model OR 5.86 (p=0.027).\n- Consistent with previous work linking rs11479 to earlier onset of fluoropyrimidine toxicity.\n\n7. MTHFR c.1298A>C (rs1801131)\n- Folate cycle variant affecting MTHFR activity (and hence TS cofactor availability).\n- C allele showed divergent toxicity patterns:\n  - Protective against pain: dominant model (A/C + C/C vs A/A) OR 0.38 (p=0.048).\n  - Associated with higher risk of nervous system disorders (dominant OR 5.81; p=0.035).\n- Adds to heterogeneous literature on MTHFR variants and fluoropyrimidine toxicity (hematologic vs mucosal vs neurologic).\n\n8. ABCB1 c.1236T>C (rs1128503)\n- Transporter involved in efflux of multiple drugs including 5\u2011FU/oxaliplatin metabolites.\n- C/C genotype associated with higher risk of pain (recessive model OR 4.20; p=0.049).\n\n9. ADR pattern in the cohort\n- Any GI disorders: 82.9% of patients, with mucositis in 34.1% and vomiting in 29.4%.\n- Nervous system disorders: 74.5% overall, neuropathy in 37.8%.\n- Hematologic disorders in 40.2% (anemia in 20.7%; thrombocytopenia in 17.1%).\n- Pain: 46.3%; fatigue: 53.7%; skin/subcutaneous disorders: 19.6%.\n- Majority of ADRs were grade 0\u20132; severe (grade 3\u20134) events were less frequent but still clinically important.\n\nMultivariate predictive models:\n1. Anemia risk model (ungrouped ADR)\n- Variables: TYMP rs11479 (T/T vs others), ABCB1 rs1045642 (T/T vs C carriers; note 1045642 is a different ABCB1 locus than 1128503, but is tightly linked).\n- Inheritance: both coded recessively.\n- Final logistic model:\n  - TYMP rs11479 T/T: OR 23.76 (95% CI 1.72\u2013986.65; p=0.038) \u2013 strong independent risk factor for anemia.\n  - ABCB1 rs1045642 T/T: trend toward protection (OR 0.15; p=0.093), not statistically significant.\n- Performance:\n  - Model p\u2011value=0.027; pseudo\u2011R\u00b2=0.145.\n  - Accuracy 71.8%, sensitivity 23.1% (low; model better at ruling out than ruling in anemia).\n  - AUC\u22480.71.\n- Interpretation: a homozygous TYMP rs11479 T/T genotype substantially increases anemia risk during 5\u2011FU\u2013based therapy in this population, but the model needs refinement and external validation.\n\n2. Pain risk model\n- Variables: ERCC2 rs13181 (C/C), MTHFR rs1801131 (A/C + C/C dominant).\n- ERCC2 C/C: independent *risk factor* for pain (OR 6.27; p=0.034).\n- MTHFR A/C or C/C: independent *protective* factor (OR 0.16; p=0.034).\n- Performance:\n  - Model p\u2011value=0.01; pseudo\u2011R\u00b2=0.185.\n  - Accuracy 72.2%, sensitivity 62.5%.\n  - AUC\u22480.75.\n- Suggests that combined DNA\u2011repair capacity (ERCC2) and folate pathway status (MTHFR) meaningfully stratify risk of clinically significant pain during treatment.\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n- DPYD: No variability for guideline\u2011listed high\u2011risk loss\u2011of\u2011function alleles (DPYD*2A, DPYD*13) in this 82\u2011patient cohort, highlighting population\u2011specific allele frequencies; however, the common DPYD*9 (rs1801265) still associated with neuropathy, supporting more comprehensive DPYD characterization (haplotypes or exome sequencing) beyond the canonical four variants.\n- TYMS: Both 3\u2032UTR ins/del and 5\u2032UTR TSER VNTR influence toxicity profiles (hematologic/GI vs skin), reinforcing TYMS as a key pharmacodynamic locus in fluoropyrimidine therapy, but with variable direction of effect across studies and populations.\n- GSTP1: Data strongly support rs1695 as a clinically relevant predictor of oxaliplatin\u2011related neuropathy in Chilean CRC patients, but the newly described association with mucositis warns that reducing neuropathy by genotype\u2011guided dosing might trade off against higher mucosal toxicity.\n- Folate pathway (MTHFR) and DNA repair (ERCC2) variants jointly shape risk of pain and neurologic toxicity, emphasizing multi\u2011gene, pathway\u2011level interactions.\n- Transporters (ABCB1) and activation enzymes (TYMP) may be particularly relevant for anemia and pain, though current multivariate models are exploratory and require larger validation cohorts before clinical adoption.\n\nLimitations:\n- Small sample (n=82) and multiple testing without strong correction raise risk of type I error; several estimates have very wide CIs.\n- Retrospective design with heterogeneous regimens (5\u2011FU vs capecitabine; \u00b1oxaliplatin, irinotecan, biologics) and potential under\u2011reporting of low\u2011grade ADRs.\n- Chilean cohort; allele frequencies and effect sizes may differ substantially from European or Asian populations.\n\nOverall conclusion from a pharmacogenomics perspective:\n- In Chilean advanced CRC patients, common variants in TYMS, DPYD, GSTP1, TYMP, MTHFR, ERCC2 and ABCB1 significantly modulate the pattern and severity of 5\u2011FU/oxaliplatin\u2011related toxicities, particularly neuropathy, hematologic toxicity, mucositis, skin events, and pain.\n- Two preliminary multigene models (for anemia and pain) achieved moderate predictive performance (AUC ~0.7\u20130.75), demonstrating the feasibility of integrating multiple pharmacogenetic markers into ADR risk prediction tools.\n- The work provides population\u2011specific evidence to inform future prospective studies and lays groundwork for genotype\u2011guided dose individualization strategies in Chile, but is not yet sufficient for routine clinical implementation.\n\nTitle:\"Genetic variants and clinical determinants affecting the response to 5-Fluorouracil-based treatment in Chilean patients with advanced colorectal cancer\"\n\npmid:\"40786508\"\n\npmcid:\"PMC12331468\"",
