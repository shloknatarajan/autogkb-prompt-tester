    "summary": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated whether specific HLA alleles are associated with severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) triggered by sulfamethoxazole (SMX) or cotrimoxazole (CTX). Six case\u2013control studies (322 SCAR cases; 236 SJS/TEN, 86 DRESS; 8448 healthy and 229 drug-tolerant controls) from diverse populations (European, Japanese, Thai, Taiwanese, Malaysian) were included.\n\nAcross all SCAR phenotypes, multiple class I HLA alleles showed significant risk associations. Compared with healthy controls, SMX/CTX-induced SCARs were associated with HLA-A*11:01 (OR\u22482.2), HLA-B*07:05 (\u22482.9), HLA-B*13:01 (\u22485.4), HLA-B*15:02 (\u22481.9), HLA-B*38:01 (\u22484.3), HLA-B*38:02 (\u22483.2), HLA-C*03:04 (\u22483.3), HLA-C*04:06 (\u22483.3), HLA-C*07:27 (\u224811.4), and HLA-C*08:01 (\u22481.5). Using SMX/CTX-tolerant controls\u2014more relevant for clinical prediction\u2014significant risk was confirmed for HLA-A*11:01 (OR 2.10), HLA-B*13:01 (5.96), HLA-B*15:02 (2.23), HLA-B*38:02 (3.47), and HLA-C*08:01 (2.63).\n\nPhenotype-specific patterns emerged:\n- SJS/TEN: strongly associated with HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*38:02 versus both healthy and tolerant controls; HLA-B*07:05, B*13:01, B*38:01, C*04:06, C*07:27, and C*08:01 were also associated in healthy-control analyses.\n- DRESS: associated with HLA-A*68:01, HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*38:01, HLA-B*39:01, HLA-C*03:04, and HLA-C*07:27 (vs healthy controls), and with HLA-A*68:01, HLA-B*13:01, and HLA-B*39:01 (vs tolerant controls). HLA-B*13:01 conferred very high risk for DRESS (OR\u224824 vs healthy; \u224823 vs tolerant controls) and was linked to both SJS/TEN and DRESS.\n\nGeographic analyses showed that:\n- HLA-B*13:01 is a major risk allele in Thai, Malaysian, and Taiwanese cohorts.\n- HLA-A*11:01 is implicated in Japanese and Thai patients.\n- HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-C*08:01 are particularly relevant in Thais.\n- HLA-B*38:02 is important in Taiwanese, and HLA-B*38:01/B*38:02 in Europeans.\n\nIn HIV-positive Thai cohorts receiving CTX (largely for Pneumocystis prophylaxis), odds ratios for several alleles (A*11:01, B*07:05, B*13:01, B*15:02, B*38:02, C*07:27, C*08:01) were even higher when compared to HIV-positive tolerant controls, suggesting additive risk in this population.\n\nMechanistically, the authors discuss that SMX and its reactive metabolite 4-nitro-SMX likely form drug\u2013HLA\u2013peptide complexes that activate specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell clones. Structural and functional work in related literature shows SMX/4-nitro-SMX can bind pockets in HLA-B*13:01 and HLA-B*38:02, and that overlapping risk with dapsone hypersensitivity (also linked to HLA-B*13:01) may underlie observed cross-reactivity. TCR usage (e.g., V\u03b220-1) and class II HLA-DQ\u2013restricted CD4+ responses may further shape phenotype-specific outcomes (SJS/TEN vs DRESS).\n\nKey limitations include dominance of Southeast Asian cohorts, mixture of SMX vs CTX as culprit drugs, limited tolerant-control data, incomplete phenotype stratification in some studies, and potential confounding by HLA haplotype linkage disequilibrium (e.g., A*11:01\u2013B*15:02\u2013C*08:01 in East Asians).\n\nClinically, the study supports that multiple HLA alleles\u2014especially HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*38:02, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*68:01, HLA-B*39:01, and HLA-C*08:01\u2014confer increased risk of SMX/CTX-induced SCARs, with phenotype- and ancestry-specific patterns. While not yet ready for universal guideline-level implementation, these data argue for consideration of pre-prescription HLA screening in high-incidence populations (e.g., Southeast Asians, particularly for HIV-positive individuals on CTX), analogous to carbamazepine\u2013HLA testing, pending further validation and cost-effectiveness analyses.",
