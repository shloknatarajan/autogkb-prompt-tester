    "summary": "Study aim and design:\nProspective cohort of 50 Syrian coronary artery disease patients undergoing PCI and treated with dual antiplatelet therapy including a routinely prescribed doubled maintenance clopidogrel dose (150 mg/day, for \u22651 month). CYP2C19*2, *3, and *17 were genotyped by PCR\u2013Sanger sequencing; predicted phenotypes were assigned per 2022 CPIC guidelines. Patients were followed for 18\u201324 months for recurrent ischemic events (refractory angina, MACE) and bleeding.\n\nCYP2C19 genotype/phenotype distribution in Syrians:\n- Allele frequencies: *2 = 8%, *3 = 0%, *17 = 17%; *10, *22, *26, *33 all 0.\n- Genotypes: one *2/*2 (2%); *1/*2 = 12%; *1/*17 = 26%; *17/*17 = 4%; remaining *1/*1.\n- Predicted phenotypes: normal metabolizer (NM) 56%, intermediate metabolizer (IM) 26%, rapid metabolizer (RM) 12%, ultrarapid metabolizer (UM) 4%, poor metabolizer (PM, *2/*2) 2%.\n- Genotype frequencies were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium.\n- The allele pattern is broadly similar to other Middle East/North Africa and European populations, and distinct from East Asian populations (higher *2, *3, lower *17 in East Asia).\n\nClinical outcomes (41 patients with follow-up data):\n- Refractory angina: 16/41 (39%).\n- Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, e.g., MI, stroke, death): 2/41 (4.9%).\n- Bleeding events: 4/41 (9.8%).\n\nImpact of CYP2C19*2 on efficacy at double dose:\n- Among *2 carriers (all IM; *1/*2 or *2/*2) vs non-carriers:\n  - Refractory angina: 33.3% vs 38.9% (P > 0.9999).\n  - MACE: 16.7% vs 2.86% (P = 0.2744).\n- No statistically significant association between *2 carrier status and recurrent angina or MACE in patients receiving 150 mg/day.\n- Authors interpret this as consistent with the possibility that increasing the maintenance dose to 150 mg/day may partially overcome loss-of-function (*2)\u2013related hyporesponsiveness in this small cohort, in line with DPWG suggestions for IMs\u2014but they emphasize that the data are underpowered and exploratory.\n\nImpact of CYP2C19*17 on bleeding at double dose:\n- *17 carriers vs non-carriers:\n  - Bleeding: 16.7% vs 6.9% (P = 0.567).\n- Trend toward more bleeding in *17 carriers, but not statistically significant.\n- No clear relationship of *2 with bleeding either (33.3% vs 5.7%, P = 0.0952), likely reflecting very small numbers.\n\nNon-genetic factors:\n- Sex, BMI category, hypertension, diabetes, PPI use, and calcium channel blocker use showed no statistically significant association with refractory angina or MACE, again with wide uncertainty due to small sample size.\n\nPharmacogenomic and clinical implications:\n- This is the first detailed description of CYP2C19*2, *3, and *17 frequencies in Syrian CAD/PCI patients.\n- The absence of a detectable *2\u2013MACE association under a double clopidogrel dose contrasts with strong evidence at the standard 75 mg/day dose, and supports\u2014but does not prove\u2014the dose-escalation strategy for IMs in this population.\n- The relatively high *17 frequency (17%) and low observed bleeding rate (<10% overall, ~17% in *17 carriers) suggest that, in this small sample, double dosing was not obviously unsafe in gain-of-function carriers, but the study is too small to rule out clinically meaningful bleeding risk.\n- Authors stress major limitations: very small cohort, only 41 patients with outcome data, relatively short and telephone-based follow-up, no platelet function testing, no assessment of other relevant pharmacogenes (e.g., ABCB1, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, PON1, CES1), and possible adherence/misclassification issues.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nFor Syrian PCI patients, CYP2C19*2 and *17 frequencies resemble other MENA/European populations. In those treated with a doubled maintenance clopidogrel dose (150 mg/day), *2 carrier status did not correlate with more ischemic events, and *17 carrier status did not significantly correlate with more bleeding, suggesting that higher dosing may attenuate genotype-driven variability. However, due to the very limited sample size and event counts, the results are hypothesis-generating; larger, genotype-guided, and platelet-function\u2013informed trials in Syrian and regional populations are needed to define optimal clopidogrel dosing or selection of alternative P2Y12 inhibitors by CYP2C19 genotype.\n\nFor pharmacogenomics practice:\n- The data support implementing CYP2C19 genotyping in Syria to characterize population risk and to guide antiplatelet strategy, but they do not yet justify changing current international guideline-based approaches.\n- Existing CPIC/DPWG/RNPGx recommendations (alternative P2Y12 inhibitor for IM/PM; consider dose escalation only in specific contexts) remain the more robust evidence base; this study provides supportive local population data but not definitive outcome evidence.\n",
