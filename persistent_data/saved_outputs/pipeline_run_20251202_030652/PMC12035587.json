    "summary": "This is a single\u2010patient pharmacogenomic case report describing severe thiopurine toxicity due to NUDT15 deficiency and using the case to argue for broader, ancestry\u2011informed genotyping before thiopurine therapy.\n\nA 41\u2011year\u2011old South Asian woman with high\u2011risk acute promyelocytic leukemia achieved molecular remission after standard induction and consolidation with ATRA/ATO\u2011based regimens. She then started maintenance therapy with ATRA, low\u2011dose oral methotrexate, and mercaptopurine every 3 weeks.\n\nAbout seven weeks into maintenance, she developed profound fatigue, bruising, recurrent menorrhagia, mucositis, extensive alopecia, and petechiae. Lab tests showed life\u2011threatening pancytopenia (Hb 60 g/L, WBC 0.9 \u00d7 10^9/L, platelets 4 \u00d7 10^9/L, ANC 0), and hepatotoxicity with elevated ALT and ALP. Infectious, nutritional, endocrine, and hemolysis work\u2011ups were unrevealing. Bone marrow biopsy was markedly hypocellular (<10%) without evidence of APL relapse.\n\nGiven the timing with thiopurine exposure and absence of alternative causes, mercaptopurine toxicity was suspected. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed normal TPMT but homozygous NUDT15*3/*3 (c.415C>T), a complete loss\u2011of\u2011function genotype. This established NUDT15\u2011deficient thiopurine toxicity as the etiology of the severe myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and alopecia. Methotrexate was considered a less likely primary driver. Mercaptopurine was stopped; the patient received transfusions, G\u2011CSF, and supportive care. She showed slow hematologic recovery and remained transfusion\u2011dependent for several weeks. Mercaptopurine was permanently discontinued.\n\nThe discussion reviews thiopurine pharmacology: 6\u2011mercaptopurine, azathioprine, and thioguanine are converted intracellularly to cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), which induce lymphocyte apoptosis by inhibiting purine synthesis, DNA/RNA synthesis, and Rac1. TPMT and NUDT15 inactivate TGNs\u2014TPMT by S\u2011methylation, NUDT15 by hydrolyzing cytotoxic triphosphate forms to monophosphates. Loss\u2011of\u2011function variants in either gene decrease inactivation, increase TGN accumulation, and greatly raise the risk of myelosuppression and other toxicities, often even at \u226590% dose reductions.\n\nThe authors contrast TPMT and NUDT15:\n- TPMT variants (*2, *3A, *3C, *3B) explain >90\u201395% of TPMT poor/intermediate metabolizers in most populations and are widely used to guide thiopurine dosing. Randomized data in IBD show that pretreatment TPMT testing plus dose adjustment reduces hematologic adverse events approximately 10\u2011fold in variant carriers.\n- In contrast, in Asians and Hispanics, thiopurine toxicity is often not explained by TPMT but by NUDT15*3, which is substantially more frequent in these groups. Homozygous NUDT15*3 patients tolerate only about 8% of the standard mercaptopurine dose before toxicity, similar in severity to TPMT poor metabolizers.\n\nFrequency data cited illustrate this ancestry effect: roughly 21% of Asians/Hispanics carry one loss\u2011of\u2011function NUDT15 allele and ~2% carry two, compared with ~10% and 0.3% respectively for TPMT loss\u2011of\u2011function in Europeans/Africans. Despite this, many clinical guidelines (especially in IBD from North America and Europe) recommend TPMT testing while giving limited or no guidance on NUDT15 testing. In contrast, pediatric ALL protocols routinely require both TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping, and several Asian IBD guidelines prioritize NUDT15 over TPMT.\n\nThe case also reinforces that alopecia can be an early, sometimes sentinel, sign of thiopurine overexposure. While initially associated predominantly with NUDT15 variants, newer data suggest severe hair loss can occur even without NUDT15 mutations, but in NUDT15\u2011deficient patients it often appears early and may precede frank marrow suppression or organ injury. Recognizing rapid or pronounced alopecia under thiopurines should prompt urgent evaluation and consideration of drug cessation plus pharmacogenetic testing.\n\nClinically, the authors conclude:\n- NUDT15*3/*3 confers extreme thiopurine sensitivity with a high risk of life\u2011threatening pancytopenia and organ toxicity, even with major dose reductions; thiopurines are generally best avoided.\n- Incorporating both TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping into pretreatment assessment\u2014particularly in Asian and Hispanic patients\u2014would improve safety and the yield of pharmacogenetic testing.\n- Guidelines should explicitly integrate population\u2011specific allele frequencies to inform which pharmacogenes to test and when.\n\nOverall, the report emphasizes that thiopurine pharmacogenomics must go beyond TPMT alone and be tailored to ancestry and clinical context, and that early signs such as alopecia should trigger prompt intervention.\n",

                "We present a case of thiopurine toxicity resulting in severe myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and alopecia in an individual with homozygous *3/*3 loss\u2010of\u2010function alleles in the NUDT15 gene.",
                "She was treated with induction chemotherapy consisting of prednisone, idarubicin, all\u2010trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), followed by 2 cycles of consolidation therapy with ATRA and ATO alone. Her postconsolidation bone marrow aspirate showed complete disease remission with undetectable PML\u2010RARA transcript levels, and she was subsequently started on maintenance therapy with ATRA, methotrexate and mercaptopurine administered every 3 weeks for a total of 8 planned cycles.",
                "Based on clinical features and the absence of a plausible alternative aetiology, a presumptive diagnosis of mercaptopurine toxicity was made. The patient underwent genetic testing and was found to have wildtype alleles in the thiopurine\u2010S\u2010methyltransferase (*TPMT*) gene, but homozygous loss\u2010of\u2010function alleles in the *NUDT15* gene (c.415C > T; *3/*3), resulting in complete loss of NUDT15 protein function. She was diagnosed with severe mercaptopurine toxicity secondary to an inherited NUDT15 protein deficiency, resulting in myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and alopecia."
