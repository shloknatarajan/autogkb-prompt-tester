    "summary": "Objective:\nTo determine whether CYP2D6 metabolizer status is associated with the risk of adverse events (AEs) from risperidone in children and adolescents, and to explore the potential clinical value of pre-emptive CYP2D6 genotyping.\n\nDesign and population:\n- Retrospective cohort using BioVU, a de-identified DNA biobank linked to electronic health records at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n- Inclusion: children \u226418 years with \u22654 weeks of risperidone exposure and available, non-compromised DNA.\n- Exclusion: care primarily outside VUMC, insufficient dosing/follow-up data, or genetically ambiguous CYP2D6 phenotype.\n- Final analyzed cohort: 257 pediatric patients (median age 8.3 years; 73% male; 84% White).\n\nCYP2D6 genotyping and phenotype assignment:\n- Next-generation sequencing (Kailos TargetRich PGx panel) plus long-range PCR for copy number variation.\n- Star-allele calling followed by phenotype categorization (poor, intermediate, normal, ultrarapid metabolizers) according to standard activity-based schemes.\n- Distribution: 15 poor (6%), 18 intermediate (7%), 218 normal (85%), 6 ultrarapid (2%).\n- For analysis, poor + intermediate were grouped (\"reduced function\"), and normal + ultrarapid were grouped (\"normal/increased function\"), due to small subgroup sizes and some ambiguous CNV cases being excluded (13 patients).\n\nExposure and outcome definitions:\n- Risperidone exposure: any use \u22654 weeks; median starting dose 0.5 mg/day (IQR 0.5\u20131 mg/day); indications primarily behavioral (e.g., aggression, behavioral problems, irritability, agitation, self-injury), often comorbid with autism, ADHD, seizure disorders, etc.\n- Primary outcome: any AE attributed to risperidone in the EHR (by clinician or caregiver report, observation, or lab change). No formal causality assessment; any temporally associated AE documented as risperidone-related was counted.\n- Detailed AE characterization (type, timing, dose at AE, management changes) was obtained via blinded manual chart review.\n\nAdverse events \u2013 frequency and types:\n- 76 of 257 patients (30%) experienced at least one AE; 104 total AE episodes across 20 AE types.\n- Most common AEs:\n  - Weight change/weight gain (~9%).\n  - Sedation (~6%).\n  - Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS; ~6%).\n- AE rates by metabolic phenotype:\n  - Poor: 5/15 (33%) with AEs.\n  - Intermediate: 10/18 (56%).\n  - Normal: 58/218 (27%).\n  - Ultrarapid: 3/6 (50%).\n\nAssociation of CYP2D6 phenotype with AEs:\n- Grouped comparison: poor/intermediate (n=33) vs normal/ultrarapid (n=224).\n- Unadjusted AE rates:\n  - Poor/intermediate: 15/33 (46%).\n  - Normal/ultrarapid: 61/224 (27%).\n  - P = 0.04.\n- Multivariable logistic regression (primary analysis):\n  - Outcome: occurrence of any AE.\n  - Main predictor: poor/intermediate vs normal/ultrarapid metabolizer.\n  - Covariates: age at risperidone start, sex, race, initial risperidone dose.\n  - Adjusted odds ratio for AE in poor/intermediate vs normal/ultrarapid: OR 2.4 (95% CI 1.1\u20135.1), P = 0.03.\n- No significant differences in demographics, comorbidities, indications, or baseline dosing between metabolizer groups, suggesting the genotype\u2013AE association is not explained by these factors.\n\nOther factors associated with AEs:\n- In univariate analyses (independent of CYP2D6 status):\n  - Race, aggression, and self-injurious behaviors were associated with higher AE rates.\n  - These associations were not clearly independent of other variables in multivariable models that included CYP2D6 status.\n\nImpact of CYP2D6 inhibitors:\n- Among normal/ultrarapid metabolizers (n=224), 20 (9%) were taking \u22651 strong CYP2D6 inhibitor concurrently.\n- AE rates:\n  - With inhibitor: 6/20 (30%).\n  - Without inhibitor: 55/204 (27%).\n  - P = 0.8.\n- Adjusted analysis in normal/ultrarapid group (controlling for age, sex, race, dose):\n  - Concomitant strong CYP2D6 inhibitor: OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.4\u20133.3), P = 0.7.\n- Interpretation: In this cohort, measured clinically significant AE risk was driven more by CYP2D6 genotype than by strong inhibitor co-medication.\n\nInterpretation in context of risperidone pharmacology:\n- Risperidone is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 to 9-hydroxyrisperidone (paliperidone), an active metabolite.\n- Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced CYP2D6 activity, leading to higher parent risperidone exposure and altered risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone ratios, which may increase risk for certain AEs (weight gain, EPS, sedation, etc.).\n- Prior pediatric data have been inconsistent due to small numbers, differing AE definitions, and different genotyping panels, but several studies converge on increased risk of weight gain and potentially other AEs in patients with reduced CYP2D6 function.\n\nStrengths:\n- Relatively large pediatric cohort (n=257) for risperidone pharmacogenetics.\n- Comprehensive CYP2D6 genotyping with CNV characterization.\n- Blinded manual AE ascertainment from detailed EHR review.\n- Adjustment for key clinical covariates (age, sex, race, starting dose) in regression.\n\nLimitations:\n- Single-center retrospective study; limited generalizability.\n- AE capture relies on documentation quality; no standardized AE rating scales or prospective causality assessment.\n- Small numbers of poor (n=15), intermediate (n=18), and ultrarapid (n=6) metabolizers; power was insufficient to analyze each phenotype class separately or to precisely characterize specific AE patterns in ultrarapid metabolizers.\n- Many patients were on multiple concomitant medications; while no major confounding was detected statistically, residual confounding by co-therapy or underlying illness severity is possible.\n\nClinical implications for pharmacogenomics:\n- CYP2D6 poor and intermediate metabolizer phenotypes approximately doubled the adjusted risk of any risperidone-related AE compared with normal/ultrarapid metabolizers.\n- About one-third of pediatric risperidone users in this cohort experienced at least one AE, underscoring the overall need for close monitoring.\n- While no CPIC or other formal dosing guideline yet exists for risperidone based on CYP2D6, this and prior data support the following genotype-informed considerations:\n  - CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers:\n    - Consider alternative antipsychotic or mood stabilizing agents that are less dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism where clinically appropriate.\n    - If risperidone is used, start at a lower dose and titrate more slowly.\n    - Implement heightened surveillance for metabolic AEs (weight, BMI, lipids, glucose), hyperprolactinemia, and movement disorders; counsel families regarding increased AE risk.\n  - CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers:\n    - Data remain limited and conflicting; some evidence suggests risk for prolactin-related AEs due to higher paliperidone exposure, but this was not seen here, likely due to small numbers.\n    - Increased vigilance is still warranted until larger studies clarify risk patterns.\n- For high-risk pediatric populations (e.g., overweight/obese patients, those with neurologic comorbidities, or those where AEs would be particularly problematic), pre-prescription CYP2D6 testing may help guide drug choice, dosing, and monitoring intensity.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nThis study provides evidence that reduced CYP2D6 function (poor or intermediate metabolizer phenotype) in children and adolescents is associated with a significantly higher risk of risperidone-attributed adverse events, independent of age, sex, race, and starting dose. Genotype-guided selection and dosing of risperidone, along with more intensive AE monitoring in reduced-function CYP2D6 phenotypes, is a reasonable strategy, and larger prospective studies are warranted to refine and standardize pharmacogenomic guidance for pediatric risperidone therapy.",
