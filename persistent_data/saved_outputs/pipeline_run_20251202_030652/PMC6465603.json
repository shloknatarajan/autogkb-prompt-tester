    "summary": "Study question and design:\nThis single-center retrospective pharmacogenetic study evaluated whether NUDT15 R139C (rs116855232) and TPMT*3C (rs1142345) variants predict azathioprine (AZA)\u2013induced leukopenia and influence tolerated AZA dose in Chinese patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and AIH\u2013PBC overlap, many with cirrhosis.\n\nPopulation and treatment:\n\u2022 149 consecutive Chinese patients with definite/probable AIH or AIH\u2013PBC variant syndrome treated with AZA \u22653 months at West China Hospital (2013\u20132017).  \n\u2022 70 had AIH\u2013PBC overlap; 81 had cirrhosis at AZA start.  \n\u2022 AZA introduced after steroids per EASL guidance; target maintenance 1\u20132 mg/kg/day.  \n\u2022 CBCs closely monitored; leukopenia defined as WBC <3\u00d710\u2079/L, or progressive worsening if pre\u2011existing.<br>\n\u2022 13 patients had leukopenia already before AZA (baseline WBC ~2.5\u00d710\u2079/L).\n\nGenotyping and metabolite measurement:\n\u2022 NUDT15 rs116855232 (C>T; p.Arg139Cys) and TPMT*3C rs1142345 (T>C; p.Leu125Leu) genotyped by PCR + Sanger sequencing.  \n\u2022 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6\u2011TGN) in RBCs measured by HPLC in 61 patients.\n\nGenotype frequencies:\n\u2022 NUDT15: CC 82.6% (123/149), CT 16.1% (24/149), TT 1.3% (2/149); T-allele frequency 9.4%.  \n\u2022 TPMT*3C: 3 heterozygotes (TC) and 1 homozygote (CC); risk allele frequency ~1.7%.\n\nIncidence and timing of leukopenia:\n\u2022 Overall AZA-induced leukopenia occurred in 12/149 (8.1%).  \n\u2022 All leukopenia episodes developed within 60 days of AZA initiation or dose escalation.  \n\u2022 No significant differences in baseline age, sex, liver function, disease severity, cirrhosis, splenomegaly, or baseline WBC between those with and without leukopenia.\n\nAssociation of NUDT15 with leukopenia:\n\u2022 Leukopenia by NUDT15 genotype:\n  \u2013 CC: 1/123 (0.8%).  \n  \u2013 CT: 9/24 (37.5%).  \n  \u2013 TT: 2/2 (100%).\n\u2022 Strong association between T allele and leukopenia:  \n  \u2013 OR 20.41 (95% CI 7.84\u201353.13), P < 0.00001.  \n  \u2013 Dominant model (CT+TT vs CC): OR 89.47 (95% CI 10.78\u2013742.53), P < 0.0001.  \n  \u2013 Recessive model (TT vs CC+CT): OR 65.48 (95% CI 2.95\u20131454.21), P = 0.008.  \n\u2022 Predictive performance of carrying at least one T allele: sensitivity 91.67%, specificity 89.05%.  \n\u2022 Among NUDT15 variant carriers (CT+TT), 11/26 (42.3%) developed AZA-induced leukopenia.\n\u2022 One TT patient with coexisting TPMT wt/risk developed life\u2011threatening grade 4 myelosuppression within 4 weeks at ~1.1 mg/kg/day; AZA was stopped and mycophenolate mofetil used thereafter. The other TT patient required dose reduction from 0.9 to 0.2 mg/kg/day.\n\nAssociation of TPMT*3C with leukopenia:\n\u2022 No significant association between TPMT*3C genotype and leukopenia (P = 0.283).  \n\u2022 Very low allele frequency in this Chinese cohort, consistent with prior Asian data; TPMT explained little of the leukopenia risk.\n\nNUDT15, 6\u2011TGN, and maintenance dose:\n\u2022 6\u2011TGN levels (61 patients):  \n  \u2013 Median (overall): 149.1 pmol/8\u00d710\u2078 RBC (range 49.7\u20131583.4).  \n  \u2013 NUDT15 CC: 145.3 (87.4\u2013199.0) pmol/8\u00d710\u2078 RBC.  \n  \u2013 NUDT15 CT: 276.6 (150.9\u2013501.0) pmol/8\u00d710\u2078 RBC.  \n  \u2013 P = 0.002 \u2192 heterozygotes accumulate significantly more active metabolite at comparable doses.\n\u2022 Among 93 patients in biochemical remission on maintenance AZA:  \n  \u2013 NUDT15 CC median maintenance dose: 1.23 (0.95\u20131.53) mg/kg/day.  \n  \u2013 NUDT15 CT median maintenance dose: 0.96 (0.83\u20131.19) mg/kg/day.  \n  \u2013 P = 0.028 \u2192 heterozygotes tolerate and require lower AZA doses.  \n\u2022 Dose/6\u2011TGN ratio (AZA dose per unit 6\u2011TGN) was significantly lower in CT vs CC (0.005 vs 0.007, P = 0.013), reinforcing that CT carriers generate more 6\u2011TGN per mg of AZA.\n\u2022 6\u2011TGN concentration itself did not differ significantly between patients with and without leukopenia (P = 0.149) and was not associated with gender, AZA maintenance dose, or cirrhosis severity.\n\nBaseline leukopenia subgroup:\n\u2022 13 patients started AZA with pre\u2011existing leukopenia (median WBC 2.48\u00d710\u2079/L);  \n  \u2013 Only 1 was NUDT15 CT; none showed progressive leukopenia on AZA.  \n  \u2013 Only one stopped AZA due to gastrointestinal side effects, not marrow toxicity.  \n  \u2013 Median maintenance dose was 1.13 (0.94\u20131.60) mg/kg/day.  \n\u2022 Suggests that, in NUDT15 wild-type patients, pre\u2011treatment leukopenia from cirrhosis/hypersplenism does not necessarily preclude safe AZA use at standard doses, though this finding needs prospective validation.\n\nBiochemical efficacy and NUDT15:\n\u2022 Among 93 patients achieving biochemical remission:  \n  \u2013 75 (80.6%) were NUDT15 CC; 17 (18.3%) were CT.  \n  \u2013 No significant difference in remission rates by genotype (P = 0.361) or time to remission (median 3.0 vs 4.0 months; P = 0.161).  \n\u2022 Thus, lowering AZA dose in NUDT15 heterozygotes to avoid leukopenia does not appear to compromise biochemical control in this cohort.\n\nClinical and pharmacogenomic implications:\n\u2022 In this Chinese AIH/AIH\u2013PBC population, NUDT15 R139C\u2014but not TPMT*3C\u2014is the main pharmacogenetic determinant of AZA\u2011induced leukopenia and tolerated dose.  \n\u2022 NUDT15 T\u2011allele carriers have markedly higher risk of early leukopenia and accumulate more 6\u2011TGN at any given AZA dose.\n\u2022 For NUDT15 CT patients with AIH or AIH\u2013PBC:\n  \u2013 Use a lower AZA maintenance dose ~1 mg/kg/day (or less) as a default target.  \n  \u2013 Intensively monitor counts in first 2 months; most leukopenia events occur early.  \n\u2022 For NUDT15 TT patients, very low starting doses (e.g., 0.1\u20130.2 mg/kg/day) or alternative immunosuppressants should be strongly considered, given near-universal severe myelosuppression at standard doses.\n\u2022 In East Asian settings, NUDT15 genotyping has higher clinical utility than TPMT for thiopurine safety; nonetheless, combined TPMT+NUDT15 testing is advisable because rare combined defects can be catastrophically toxic.\n\u2022 Standard AZA doses may still be appropriate in patients with cirrhosis or hypersplenism-related leukopenia if they are NUDT15 wild-type, but prospective data are needed.\n\nLimitations:\n\u2022 Single-center, modest sample size, rare TT and TPMT*3C variants; confidence intervals are wide for some genotype strata.  \n\u2022 Only rs116855232 and TPMT*3C were tested; rarer functional variants may have been missed.  \n\u2022 6\u2011TGN measured in only ~41% of patients.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nNUDT15 rs116855232 is a strong predictor of AZA-induced leukopenia and dose tolerance in Chinese patients with AIH and AIH\u2013PBC overlap, outperforming TPMT*3C. Heterozygous NUDT15 carriers can generally be treated safely and effectively with lower AZA doses (~1 mg/kg/day), and even in patients with cirrhosis or prior leukopenia, AZA need not be contraindicated if NUDT15 is wild-type. Routine pre\u2011treatment NUDT15 (and TPMT) genotyping should be incorporated into thiopurine prescribing for this population.\n",
