2 of these also carried rs1142345 variants.\n\u2022 Longitudinal lab parameters (WBC, neutrophils, aminotransferases, bilirubin) showed no significant genotype-based differences.\n\nInterpretation and context:\n\u2022 This is the first Colombian pediatric ALL pharmacogenomic study assessing both TPMT and NUDT15.\n\u2022 The NUDT15 risk allele frequency (0.03) was lower than in East Asian cohorts but within the range of admixed Latin American populations, likely reflecting substantial European (50\u201360%) ancestry in this Colombian Andean cohort.\n\u2022 TPMT *2 and *3A frequencies were modestly higher than a previous Colombian report but in the range described for Latin American populations; only intermediate-activity genotypes (*1/*2, *1/*3A) were observed, with no poor-metabolizer diplotypes.\n\u2022 The lack of statistically significant genotype\u2013toxicity associations is plausibly explained by:\n  \u2013 Small sample size (68 genotyped patients, very few variant carriers), which limits power.\n  \u2013 Absence of TPMT or NUDT15 poor metabolizers (no homozygous risk genotypes).\n  \u2013 Possible differences in ancestry structure and environmental or treatment factors relative to the populations in which strong associations have been reported.\n\nImplications for pharmacogenomics and clinical practice:\n\u2022 In this real-world Colombian pediatric ALL cohort, TPMT and NUDT15 variants as tested (major CPIC-relevant alleles) did not predict 6\u2011MP toxicity or dose adjustments during the first 6 months of BFM ALLIC 2009 maintenance.\n\u2022 Given the low frequency of high-risk genotypes, routine testing may yield few actionable findings in this setting unless done in larger or pooled cohorts.\n\u2022 Nonetheless, given robust evidence from other populations and current CPIC guidelines, TPMT/NUDT15 genotyping remains biologically and clinically relevant; this study emphasizes that effect sizes and allele frequencies may vary by ancestry, reinforcing the need for local data.\n\nAuthors\u2019 conclusions and recommendations:\n\u2022 Allele frequencies of TPMT and NUDT15 in this Colombian cohort differ somewhat from previously described Latin American estimates, but fall within a broadly similar range.\n\u2022 No statistically significant associations were identified between the polymorphisms studied and thiopurine-related toxicity or treatment modifications.\n\u2022 Larger, ideally multicenter, studies in Colombia and Latin America are needed to:\n  \u2013 Achieve adequate power to detect genotype\u2013toxicity relationships.\n  \u2013 Investigate additional variants in TPMT, NUDT15 and other thiopurine pathway genes.\n  \u2013 Explore the role of detailed genetic ancestry in modifying pharmacogenomic effects.\n\u2022 The authors highlight the need to search for \u201cautochthonous biomarkers\u201d tailored to admixed Latin American populations to better predict thiopurine toxicity in pediatric oncology and potentially in other thiopurine-treated pediatric diseases (e.g., IBD, JIA).",
