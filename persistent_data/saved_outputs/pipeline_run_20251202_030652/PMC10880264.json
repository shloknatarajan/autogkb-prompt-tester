    "summary": "Objective:\nTo examine how pharmacogenetic variation in CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A and SLC6A4 influences escitalopram pharmacokinetics and treatment\u2011emergent adverse events in depressed and/or anxious adolescents who have a first\u2011degree relative with bipolar I disorder (i.e., are at familial high risk for BD).\n\nDesign and population:\n- Double\u2011blind RCT parent study (psychotherapy + escitalopram vs psychotherapy + placebo); this pharmacogenetic analysis focuses only on the escitalopram\u2011treated arm.\n- Youth aged 12\u201317 years, antidepressant\u2011na\u00efve, with clinically significant depression and/or anxiety and at least one first\u2011degree relative with bipolar I disorder.\n- N = 66 escitalopram\u2011treated participants with pharmacogenetic data; N = 48 of these also had escitalopram serum levels and PK modeling.\n\nTreatment and assessments:\n- Escitalopram 5 mg \u2192 10 mg \u2192 target 20 mg/day (max 30 mg), flexible titration.\n- Adverse outcomes captured by:\n  - Clinician\u2011defined \u201chyperarousal event\u201d (CGI\u2011Severity of Activation + CGAS criteria).\n  - Pediatric Adverse Events Rating Scale (PAERS; 13 arousal\u2011related items, maximum severity after baseline).\n  - Treatment\u2011Emergent Activation and Suicidality Assessment Profile (TEASAP) caregiver\u2011reported subscales: (1) self\u2011injury/suicidality/harm to others, (2) mania, (3) akathisia/hyperkinesis/somatic anxiety, (4) disinhibition/impulsivity, (5) irritability.\n- Genotyping (Myriad panel): CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A \u22121438G>A (rs6311) and SLC6A4 5\u2011HTTLPR; CYP phenotypes assigned per CPIC.\n- Escitalopram PK (one or limited samples) modeled using Bayesian population PK (MwPharm, Strawn et al model) to estimate Cmax, Ctrough, AUC0\u201324 and t1/2; PK compared across CYP phenotypes (dose\u2011normalized for gene\u2013PK analyses; non\u2011normalized for exposure\u2013AE analyses).\n\nKey pharmacokinetic findings:\n1. CYP2C19 strongly influences escitalopram exposure in youth.\n- Phenotype distribution (PK subset, n=48): IM 21%, NM 50%, RM 27%, UM 2%; no poor metabolizers.\n- Slower CYP2C19 metabolism (IM > NM > RM/UM) was associated with:\n  - Higher dose\u2011normalized AUC0\u201324 (p = 0.025).\n  - Higher dose\u2011normalized Ctrough (p = 0.013).\n  - Longer escitalopram half\u2011life (t1/2; p = 0.0008).\n- Trend toward higher dose\u2011normalized Cmax in slower metabolizers (p = 0.057).\n- Confirms CPIC guidance: CYP2C19, not CYP2D6, is the primary PK driver for escitalopram in youth.\n\n2. CYP2D6 does not measurably affect escitalopram parent\u2011drug PK.\n- Phenotypes: PM 6%, IM 23%, NM 65%, UM 3%; 2 indeterminate.\n- No significant associations between CYP2D6 phenotype and dose\u2011normalized AUC, Cmax, Ctrough, or t1/2 (all p > 0.48).\n- Consistent with CYP2D6 having only a minor role in parent escitalopram clearance.\n\n3. Escitalopram exposure vs. adverse events.\n- Escitalopram Cmax and AUC0\u201324 (non\u2013dose\u2011normalized) were not significantly associated with:\n  - Hyperarousal events, nor\n  - TEASAP subscale changes.\n- There was a non\u2011significant trend for higher exposure to be associated with *lower* PAERS scores (p \u2248 0.11), opposite to the prior hypothesis that higher levels would drive more side effects.\n\nPharmacogenetic associations with adverse events:\n\nCYP2C19 \u2192 AEs\n- Despite clear PK effects, CYP2C19 phenotype was *not* significantly associated with:\n  - Hyperarousal event frequency.\n  - PAERS max scores.\n  - TEASAP mania, akathisia, disinhibition, or irritability subscales.\n- There was a non\u2011significant trend for higher TEASAP self\u2011injury/suicidality/harm\u2011to\u2011others scores in slower CYP2C19 metabolizers (p = 0.09), but this did not reach conventional significance and no poor metabolizers were present.\n\nCYP2D6 \u2192 activation\u2011like AEs (novel signal)\n- Slower CYP2D6 metabolizers (PM/IM) showed more SSRI\u2011like activation symptoms despite similar parent\u2011drug PK:\n  - TEASAP akathisia/hyperkinesis/somatic anxiety subscale: significantly higher in slower CYP2D6 phenotypes (p = 0.015 across PM/IM/NM/UM).\n  - When grouped as \u201cslower than normal\u201d (PM+IM) vs \u201cnormal/faster\u201d (NM+UM), slower CYP2D6 was also associated with:\n    - Higher disinhibition/impulsivity scores (mean 3.0 vs 1.1, p = 0.02).\n    - Trends toward higher mania and akathisia/hyperkinesis/somatic anxiety scores (p \u2248 0.07\u20130.08).\n- CYP2D6 phenotype was not associated with overall PAERS scores or hyperarousal event incidence.\n- Interpretation: CYP2D6 may modulate *activation\u2011type behavioral AEs* independent of parent escitalopram levels\u2014possibly by altering exposure to the active metabolite desmethylescitalopram, which is preferentially cleared by CYP2D6 and has a distinct pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., some NET binding, different receptor activities).\n\nHTR2A \u2192 suicidality/harm\u2011related behaviors\n- Genotype groups: 44% G/G, 56% A allele carriers (A/A or A/G).\n- A allele carriers (A/A + A/G) exhibited significantly greater increases in TEASAP \u201cself\u2011injury, suicidality, and harm to others\u201d scores than G/G homozygotes (p = 0.017).\n- No significant effect of HTR2A genotype on:\n  - Other TEASAP subscales (mania, akathisia, disinhibition, irritability).\n  - PAERS total.\n  - Categorical hyperarousal events.\n- This contrasts with earlier work where G/G was more associated with somatic side effects (e.g., nausea, dizziness) on SSRIs; here, A\u2011carriers appear at higher risk for high\u2011risk/suicidality\u2011related behaviors under escitalopram.\n- Suggests HTR2A may differentially predict somatic vs psychiatric AEs across genotypes and drugs.\n\nSLC6A4 \u2192 no association with AEs in this cohort\n- Genotype distribution: S/S 24%, L/S 56%, L/L 20%.\n- No significant associations between SLC6A4 S/S vs L\u2011carriers (L/L+L/S) and:\n  - TEASAP subscales.\n  - PAERS.\n  - Hyperarousal events.\n- This negative finding contrasts with prior studies implicating S/S in greater activation, mania\u2011like symptoms, or poorer SSRI response, but the current sample was relatively small.\n\nHyperarousal events\n- 14 escitalopram\u2011treated participants experienced a clinician\u2011defined hyperarousal event; 12 had genotype data; 5 had PK data.\n- No clear pharmacokinetic predictor (Cmax, AUC) or robust pharmacogenetic predictor of these discrete events was identified, likely due to low numbers and under\u2011representation of hyperarousal cases in the PK subset.\n\nClinical and research implications:\n1. CYP2C19:\n   - Strongly shapes escitalopram exposure in high\u2011risk youth, supporting CPIC\u2011style dose adjustment in pediatrics.\n   - However, within this modestly sized cohort lacking CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, CYP2C19 phenotype did not significantly predict activation or other escitalopram\u2011related AEs.\n\n2. CYP2D6:\n   - Does *not* materially affect escitalopram parent\u2011drug PK, but slower metabolizers showed more akathisia\u2011like and disinhibition symptoms.\n   - Raises the hypothesis that CYP2D6\u2011mediated handling of active metabolites (e.g., desmethylescitalopram) could influence behavioral activation independent of parent\u2011drug exposure.\n   - Clinically, youth at familial risk for BD who are CYP2D6 slower metabolizers may warrant closer monitoring for akathisia/activation and impulsivity when exposed to escitalopram or related SSRIs.\n\n3. HTR2A:\n   - A\u2011allele carriers (A/A or A/G) appear more vulnerable to increases in caregiver\u2011reported self\u2011injury/suicidality/harm\u2011to\u2011others under escitalopram.\n   - If replicated, HTR2A could be used as an additional risk marker for SSRI\u2011associated suicidal or aggressive behaviors in high\u2011risk youth, distinct from CYP\u2011based PK considerations.\n\n4. SLC6A4:\n   - No AE signal in this small cohort; does not rule out effects on efficacy or on other phenotypes but suggests that, at least for escitalopram\u2011induced activation in familial\u2011risk youth, SLC6A4 is not a major determinant.\n\n5. General:\n   - The overall AE burden did not clearly correlate with escitalopram exposure (Cmax/AUC), suggesting that idiosyncratic pharmacodynamic mechanisms and metabolite effects may be more important than steady\u2011state parent\u2011drug levels for activation\u2011like AEs in this context.\n\nLimitations:\n- Small sample size for pharmacogenetic subgroup analyses, especially for extreme CYP phenotypes (no CYP2C19 PMs, few CYP2D6 PMs/UMs).\n- Only 48 had PK data and only 5 of 14 hyperarousal cases contributed PK samples \u2192 limited power to detect exposure\u2013AE relationships.\n- Multiple statistical tests performed without correction \u2192 risk of type I error; findings should be considered preliminary and hypothesis\u2011generating.\n- Single time\u2011point PK modeling and no direct measurement of desmethylescitalopram or didesmethylescitalopram.\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- In high\u2011risk adolescents treated with escitalopram, CYP2C19 phenotype robustly influences escitalopram pharmacokinetics but did not, in this small sample, translate into clear differences in activation or other AEs.\n- CYP2D6 slower\u2011metabolizer status and HTR2A A\u2011allele genotypes were associated with more activation\u2011like and suicidality/harm\u2011related behavioral AEs, respectively, despite minimal effect of CYP2D6 on parent\u2011drug PK.\n- These preliminary findings suggest that integrating CYP2D6 and HTR2A into pharmacogenomic risk assessment may help identify youth at elevated risk for escitalopram\u2011associated activation and self\u2011harm/aggression, but larger, prospectively powered cohorts are needed before changing clinical practice.\n\n\nPMID: 38377518\nPMCID: PMC10880264\nTitle: Pharmacogenetic Factors Influence Escitalopram Pharmacokinetics and Adverse Events in Youth with a Family History of Bipolar Disorder: A Preliminary Study",
