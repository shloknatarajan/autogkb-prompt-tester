Among the seven genetic variants identified, three variants (c.1236G>A or rs56038477 p.Glu412Glu ; c.496A>G or rs2297595 p.Met166Val; DPYD*6 c.2194G>A or rs1801160 p.Val732Ile) were significantly more frequent in the group of patients exhibiting partial DPD deficiency. Consistent with previous reports, the c.1236G>A (rs56038477) which is included in the risk haplotype B3 was significantly associated with low DPD activity [30, 31]. Nevertheless, compared to the most clinically relevant DPYD defective variants, the association of these three variants with DPD activity was rather modest (Fig. 2).",
